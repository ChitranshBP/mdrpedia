  "biography": "Benjamin Solomon Carson Sr. (born 1951) is an American retired neurosurgeon who gained international acclaim in 1987 for leading a 70-member surgical team in the first successful separation of conjoined twins joined at the back of the head (occipital craniopagus twins). Born in Detroit, Michigan, he earned his BA in Psychology from Yale University and his MD from the University of Michigan Medical School. In 1984, at age 33, he became the youngest chief of pediatric neurosurgery in the United States at Johns Hopkins Children's Center. He is credited with refining the hemispherectomy procedure for controlling severe pediatric epilepsy. Over his career he authored more than 100 neurosurgical publications. Beyond surgery, he served as the 17th U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (2017–2021).",
