He would be adept at interpreting biopsy results, correlating them with clinical and laboratory findings to establish a definitive diagnosis.\n*   **Paracentesis:** He would be skilled in performing paracentesis, a procedure to remove ascitic fluid from the abdomen, for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. He would be knowledgeable about the complications of paracentesis and able to manage them effectively.\n*   **FibroScan:** Given the non-invasive nature of FibroScan and its utility in assessing liver fibrosis, Dr. Aggarwal would likely utilize this technology regularly in his practice. He would be proficient in performing and interpreting FibroScan results, using them to monitor disease progression and response to therapy.\n*   **Endoscopy:** While not directly hepatological, his understanding of portal hypertension necessitates proficiency in upper endoscopy to screen for and manage esophageal varices.\n\n**Management of Viral Hepatitis:**\n\n*   **Hepatitis B:** Dr. Aggarwal would possess in-depth knowledge of the natural history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, including the various phases of the disease and the indications for antiviral therapy. He would be skilled in selecting appropriate antiviral agents (e.g., entecavir, tenofovir) based on patient characteristics and resistance profiles. He would also be adept at monitoring treatment response and managing complications such as drug resistance and flares of hepatitis.\n*   **Hepatitis C:** He would be highly knowledgeable about the diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. He would be proficient in selecting appropriate direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens based on HCV genotype and the presence of cirrhosis. He would also be skilled in managing patients with treatment failure and those with advanced liver disease.\n*   **Hepatitis A and E:** Dr. Aggarwal would be knowledgeable about these acute forms of viral hepatitis, including diagnosis, supportive care, and preventative measures.\n\n**Management of Complications of Liver Disease:**\n\n*   **Cirrhosis:** Dr. Aggarwal would be experienced in managing the complications of cirrhosis, including ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. He would be skilled in implementing evidence-based strategies to prevent and treat these complications.\n*   **Liver Failure:** He would be able to assess and manage patients with acute and chronic liver failure, collaborating with transplant teams to determine candidacy for liver transplantation.\n*   **Hepatocellular Carcinoma:** Dr. Aggarwal would be knowledgeable about the diagnosis and management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer.
