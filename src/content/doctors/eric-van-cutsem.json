  "biography": "Blueberry is a 2004 French acid Western directed by Jan Kounen. It is an adaptation of the Franco-Belgian comic book series Blueberry, illustrated by Jean Giraud and scripted by Jean-Michel Charlier, but the film has little in common with the source material. The film stars Vincent Cassel as the title character along with Michael Madsen, Juliette Lewis, Djimon Hounsou, Eddie Izzard, Temuera Morrison, Tchéky Karyo, Kestenbetsa, and Ernest Borgnine. Although the film is a French production, the film is in English to match the story's setting in America's Wild West in the 1870s. Since the character of Blueberry remains obscure in the States, the film was released on DVD in America in November 2004 under the title Renegade and marketed very much as a conventional Western.",
