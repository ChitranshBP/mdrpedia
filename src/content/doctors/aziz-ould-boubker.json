  "biography": "The Oulad Bou Sbaa is an Arab Chorfa/Zaouia tribe, who claim descent from Abu Sib'a, the Idrissid 16th century Tribal Chief. They live in Morocco, Western Sahara and Mauritania, with members of the tribe holding different nationalities depending on their residence and upbringings. In the 19th and 20th century, the tribe's influence in its core areas of southern Spanish Sahara was diminished and permanently weakened following heavy defeat in bloody battles against the Reguibat tribal Confederations, which were then rapidly asserting their influence over these areas. Speakers of Hassaniya Arabic, they were nomadic (Bedouin) and herded camels in today's Western Sahara and Mauritania.",
