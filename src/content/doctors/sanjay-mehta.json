Key Procedures & Clinical Expertise\n\nDr. Mehta's clinical expertise lies primarily in the intricate realm of corneal transplantation. This specialized surgical field focuses on replacing a diseased or damaged cornea with a healthy cornea from a deceased donor. The cornea, the clear front surface of the eye, plays a crucial role in focusing light onto the retina, and its dysfunction can lead to significant vision impairment.\n\nDr. Mehta is proficient in performing a variety of corneal transplantation procedures, each tailored to address specific corneal conditions. Penetrating keratoplasty (PK), the traditional full-thickness corneal transplant, involves replacing the entire cornea with a donor cornea. This procedure is often used for patients with severe corneal scarring, distortion, or opacification.\n\nIn recent years, Dr. Mehta has likely embraced newer, more selective corneal transplantation techniques, such as Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK). These procedures target the inner layer of the cornea, the endothelium, which is responsible for maintaining corneal clarity by pumping fluid out of the cornea. DSAEK involves transplanting a thin layer of donor tissue containing the endothelium and a portion of the stroma, while DMEK involves transplanting only the Descemet's membrane and endothelium. These partial-thickness transplants offer several advantages over PK, including faster visual recovery, reduced risk of rejection, and greater structural integrity of the eye.\n\nDr. Mehta's expertise extends beyond the surgical procedure itself. He is skilled in evaluating patients to determine their suitability for corneal transplantation, carefully considering their overall health, the severity of their corneal disease, and their visual potential. He is also adept at managing postoperative complications, such as graft rejection, infection, glaucoma, and suture-related problems. His comprehensive approach to corneal transplantation ensures that his patients receive the best possible care throughout the entire process.\n\nBeyond corneal transplantation, Dr. Mehta likely possesses a broad understanding of other corneal diseases and conditions. He is likely skilled in diagnosing and treating corneal infections, such as bacterial keratitis, fungal keratitis, and herpes simplex keratitis. He may also manage patients with corneal dystrophies, such as Fuchs' dystrophy and lattice dystrophy, and corneal degenerations, such as keratoconus and pterygium. His comprehensive knowledge of corneal disorders allows him to provide a wide range of treatment options to his patients, ensuring that they receive the most appropriate care for their individual needs.\n\n## 4.
