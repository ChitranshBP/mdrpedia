He is the inaugural Niess-Gain Professor at Washington University School of Medicine, where he is associate director for Prevention and Control at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center. He directs the Master of Population Health Science at Washington University School of Medicine. During medical training he was excited by the potential for prevention of chronic diseases. With encouragement from mentors he pursued training in the US as it was routine for academics in Australia to obtain overseas training at that time. He is internationally recognized for leadership in cancer prevention, and is often interviewed by media for input on this topic. With members of Cancer Prevention and Control at Siteman, he blogs on issues relating to cancer prevention and screening and has a monthly syndicated health column titled For Your Health. According to Google Scholar statistics, Colditz has a h-index of more than 300. Colditz was a member of the Institute of Medicine Committee to Review Adverse Effects of Vaccines but resigned, along with Ruby H. N. Nguyen, before it produced its seminal report. In 2024, Colditz co-founded Prognosia Inc. with Shu Jiang, with the goal of making their breast cancer prevention tool available to women and healthcare providers. The technology received Breakthrough Device Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June, 2025. And Prognosia was purchased by Lunit in September 2025",
