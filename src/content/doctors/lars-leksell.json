  "biography": "Lars Leksell (1907–1986) was a Swedish neurosurgeon and professor at the Karolinska Institute who invented radiosurgery and developed the Gamma Knife. Born in Fässberg, Sweden, he completed his medical studies at the Karolinska Institute and began neurosurgical training in 1935 under Herbert Olivecrona. In 1949, he introduced an arc-centered stereotactic frame for precisely targeting brain structures. In 1951, in collaboration with physicist Börje Larsson, he conceived the idea of radiosurgery — using focused radiation beams to destroy intracranial targets without opening the skull. The first Gamma Knife prototype was developed in 1967, and Leksell subsequently treated 762 patients with the device. He succeeded Olivecrona as chairman of neurosurgery at Karolinska in 1961 and founded Elekta AB in 1972 to commercialize his instruments.",
