  "biography": "Robert F. Spetzler (born 1944) is a German-born American neurosurgeon who served as Director and J.N. Harber Chairman of Neurological Surgery at the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) in Phoenix, Arizona from 1983 to 2017. Under his leadership, BNI became one of the world's premier neurosurgical centers. Born in Stierhöfstetten, Germany, he moved to the United States at age 11. He earned his MD from Northwestern Medical School in 1971 and completed his neurosurgical residency at UCSF under Charles B. Wilson. Spetzler pioneered techniques using hypothermia and cardiac arrest for treating complex brain lesions, and developed the Spetzler-Martin grading system for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) — now the worldwide standard for surgical risk assessment. He has published over 850 articles and co-edited multiple neurosurgical textbooks.",
