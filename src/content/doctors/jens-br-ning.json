Key Procedures & Clinical Expertise\n\nAs a general endocrinologist, Dr. Brüning's clinical expertise likely encompasses a broad range of endocrine disorders. While specific procedures are not detailed, his proficiency would include:\n\n*   **Diabetes Management:** Expertise in the diagnosis and management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, and other forms of diabetes. This would involve the use of insulin therapy, oral medications, lifestyle modifications, and continuous glucose monitoring systems. He would also be proficient in managing diabetes-related complications, such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy.\n\n*   **Thyroid Disorders:** Extensive knowledge of thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroid nodules, and thyroid cancer. He would be skilled in performing thyroid examinations, interpreting thyroid function tests, and managing thyroid hormone replacement therapy or anti-thyroid medications. He would also collaborate with surgeons in the management of thyroid cancer.\n\n*   **Adrenal Disorders:** Expertise in the diagnosis and management of adrenal disorders, such as adrenal insufficiency, Cushing's syndrome, and pheochromocytoma. This would involve the use of hormone replacement therapy, medications to suppress hormone production, and surgical interventions when necessary.\n\n*   **Pituitary Disorders:** In-depth knowledge of pituitary disorders, such as pituitary adenomas, acromegaly, and Cushing's disease. He would be skilled in interpreting pituitary hormone levels, performing dynamic testing of pituitary function, and managing hormone replacement therapy or medications to suppress hormone production. He would also collaborate with neurosurgeons in the management of pituitary tumors.\n\n*   **Reproductive Endocrinology:** Understanding of reproductive endocrine disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hypogonadism, and infertility. He would be skilled in managing hormonal imbalances, inducing ovulation, and providing counseling on reproductive health.\n\nWhile not necessarily performing them himself, Dr. Brüning would also be proficient in interpreting the results of diagnostic procedures commonly used in endocrinology, such as fine needle aspiration of thyroid nodules, bone density scans, and imaging studies of the endocrine glands.\n\n### 4.
