  "biography": "Denton Arthur Cooley (1920–2016) was an American heart surgeon who performed more open-heart operations than any other surgeon in history. In 1969, he implanted the first total artificial heart in a human patient at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston. He founded the Texas Heart Institute in 1962, transforming it into the world's largest center for cardiovascular surgery and research. A graduate of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Cooley trained under Alfred Blalock and assisted in the first 'Blue Baby' operation in 1944. Over his 60-year career, he performed approximately 120,000 open-heart surgeries and pioneered techniques for aortic dissection repair.",
