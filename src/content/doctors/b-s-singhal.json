  "biography": "<h3>Executive Summary</h3><p><strong>Dr. Bhimsen Singhal</strong> (Dr. B. S. Singhal) is the doyen of Indian Neurology and a globally respected authority on <strong>Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</strong> and <strong>Parkinson's Disease</strong>. Currently the Director of Neurology at Bombay Hospital, he is credited with defining the clinical profile of MS in India, debunking the earlier belief that the disease was rare in the subcontinent. He is the founder of the <strong>Multiple Sclerosis Society of India (MSSI)</strong> and the <strong>Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorder Society (PDMDS)</strong>.</p><h3>Early Life and Education</h3><p>Born in Mount Abu, Dr. Singhal completed his medical education at Grant Medical College, Mumbai. He proceeded to the United Kingdom for advanced training at the prestigious <strong>Institute of Neurology, Queen Square</strong>, London, returning to India in 1962 to dedicate his life to serving his countrymen.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Dr. Singhal has headed the Department of Neurology at Bombay Hospital for over five decades. His clinic has been the last court of appeal for complex neurological cases from across India and Africa. He has held the presidency of the Neurological Society of India and the Asian Oceanian Association of Neurology.</p><h3>Key Contributions & Innovations</h3><ul><li><strong>Megalencephalic Leukoencephalopathy with subcortical Cysts (MLC):</strong> He identified and characterized a unique form of leukodystrophy prevalent in the Agrawal community, now globally recognized as <strong>Singhal's Disease</strong> (or MLC). His collaboration with Dutch researchers led to the identification of the gene responsible for this condition.</li><li><strong>Multiple Sclerosis in India:</strong> His epidemiological studies laid the foundation for understanding the prevalence and phenotype of MS in Indian populations, leading to better diagnostic protocols.</li><li><strong>Patient Advocacy:</strong> By founding MSSI and PDMDS, he created the first robust support ecosystems for patients with chronic neurodegenerative diseases in India.</li></ul><h3>Awards and Recognition</h3><ul><li><strong>Padma Shri (2022):</strong> Honored for his distinguished service in Medicine.</li><li><strong>Dr. B.C. Roy National Award:</strong> For developing the specialty of Neurology in India.</li><li><strong>Dhanvantari Award:</strong> For outstanding contributions to medical science.</li></ul><h3>Legacy</h3><p>Dr. Singhal's impact transcends clinical practice. He championed the cause of 'Non-Communicable Diseases' when infectious diseases still dominated the Indian health agenda. At 91, he remains active in research and philanthropy, embodying the highest ideals of the medical profession.</p>",
  "aiSummary": "B. S. Singhal is a Elite-tier (top 1%) neurology specialist with an H-index of 37 at Bombay Hospital (Director of Neurology).
