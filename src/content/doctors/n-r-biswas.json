Key Procedures & Clinical Expertise\n\nDr. Biswas's expertise lies in the intricate realm of retina surgery. His specialization allows him to address a wide spectrum of vision-threatening conditions affecting the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. While specific details of his surgical repertoire remain private, based on general knowledge of the field, it's reasonable to infer the procedures and clinical areas he's proficient in.\n\n*   **Vitrectomy:** This surgical procedure involves removing the vitreous gel, the clear jelly-like substance that fills the eye. Vitrectomy is commonly performed to treat conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachments, macular holes, and epiretinal membranes. Dr. Biswas likely employs advanced vitrectomy techniques, utilizing small-gauge instruments to minimize trauma and promote faster healing. He likely has extensive experience in managing complex vitrectomy cases, including those involving bleeding, inflammation, or scarring.\n\n*   **Retinal Detachment Repair:** Retinal detachment is a serious condition that occurs when the retina separates from the underlying tissue. Dr. Biswas likely utilizes various techniques to repair retinal detachments, including scleral buckling, pneumatic retinopexy, and vitrectomy. Scleral buckling involves placing a silicone band around the eye to indent the sclera (the white outer layer of the eye) and relieve traction on the retina. Pneumatic retinopexy involves injecting a gas bubble into the eye to reattach the retina. The choice of technique depends on the type and location of the retinal detachment.\n\n*   **Macular Degeneration Treatment:** Macular degeneration is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults. Dr. Biswas likely offers a range of treatments for macular degeneration, including anti-VEGF injections, laser photocoagulation, and photodynamic therapy. Anti-VEGF injections are used to block the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the macula (the central part of the retina). Laser photocoagulation is used to seal leaky blood vessels. Photodynamic therapy involves injecting a light-sensitive drug into the bloodstream and then using a laser to activate the drug and destroy abnormal blood vessels.\n\n*   **Diabetic Retinopathy Management:** Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that can damage the blood vessels in the retina. Dr. Biswas likely provides comprehensive management of diabetic retinopathy, including laser photocoagulation, anti-VEGF injections, and vitrectomy. He likely works closely with endocrinologists and primary care physicians to optimize blood sugar control and prevent the progression of diabetic retinopathy.\n\n*   **Macular Hole Repair:** A macular hole is a small break in the macula that can cause blurred vision. Dr. Biswas likely performs vitrectomy surgery to repair macular holes, often involving the use of internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling to promote closure of the hole.\n\n*   **Epiretinal Membrane Peeling:** An epiretinal membrane is a thin layer of tissue that can form on the surface of the retina, causing blurred or distorted vision. Dr. Biswas likely performs vitrectomy surgery to peel the epiretinal membrane off the retina, restoring clearer vision.\n\nHis clinical expertise likely extends beyond surgical procedures to include the diagnosis and management of a wide range of other retinal conditions, such as retinal vascular occlusions, uveitis, and inherited retinal diseases.
