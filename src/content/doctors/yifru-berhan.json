  "biography": "Eclampsia is the onset of seizures (convulsions) in a pregnant woman with pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that presents with three main features: new onset of high blood pressure, large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction, and edema. If left untreated, pre-eclampsia can result in long-term consequences for the pregnant woman, namely increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and associated complications. In more severe cases, it may be fatal for both the pregnant woman and the fetus.",
