  "biography": "Harvey Williams Cushing (1869–1939) is universally recognized as the father of modern neurosurgery. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, to a family of physicians, he graduated from Yale University in 1891 and Harvard Medical School in 1895. He completed surgical training at Johns Hopkins under William Halsted. Cushing became the first full-time neurosurgeon in the United States, developing techniques that reduced brain surgery mortality from nearly 90% to less than 10%. He performed over 2,000 brain tumor operations, pioneered electrocautery with William T. Bovie, introduced continuous blood pressure monitoring during operations, and discovered the hormonal disorder now known as Cushing's disease (1912). He authored over 300 scientific articles and won the 1926 Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Sir William Osler. The Harvey Cushing Society — now the American Association of Neurological Surgeons — was founded by his disciples.",
