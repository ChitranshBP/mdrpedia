He adheres to the highest standards of medical ethics, ensuring that his patients' privacy and confidentiality are always protected. He also believes in the importance of collaboration and works closely with other healthcare professionals, such as oncologists, surgeons, and genetic counselors, to provide his patients with comprehensive and coordinated care.\n\n### 3. **Key Procedures & Clinical Expertise**\n\nDr. Venkitaraman's expertise in BRCA genetics encompasses a wide range of clinical procedures and diagnostic techniques. His primary focus lies in the interpretation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic test results, as well as those of other related genes involved in DNA repair and cancer susceptibility. He possesses a deep understanding of the complex genetic variations that can occur in these genes and is skilled at determining whether a particular variant is pathogenic, likely pathogenic, of uncertain significance, likely benign, or benign.\n\nA significant portion of Dr. Venkitaraman's clinical practice involves genetic counseling. He provides comprehensive counseling to individuals who are considering BRCA testing, as well as to those who have already received a positive result. He explains the implications of BRCA mutations in detail, including the increased risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other cancers. He also discusses the various options for risk reduction, such as increased surveillance, prophylactic surgery, and chemoprevention. He tailors his counseling to each individual's specific circumstances, taking into account their family history, personal preferences, and cultural background.\n\nDr. Venkitaraman is also skilled in performing risk assessments for individuals with a family history of cancer. He utilizes validated risk assessment tools to estimate an individual's likelihood of carrying a BRCA mutation or developing cancer. He takes a detailed family history, including information about the types of cancer diagnosed, the age of onset, and the relationship to the affected individuals. Based on this information, he can recommend appropriate screening and prevention strategies.\n\nIn addition to genetic testing and counseling, Dr. Venkitaraman also provides medical management for individuals with BRCA mutations. This may include recommending increased screening for breast and ovarian cancer, such as annual mammograms, breast MRIs, and transvaginal ultrasounds. He may also refer patients to surgeons for consideration of prophylactic mastectomy or oophorectomy. He works closely with oncologists to develop personalized treatment plans for patients who have been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancers.\n\nDr. Venkitaraman is adept at utilizing the latest advancements in BRCA testing technology, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). He understands the limitations of these technologies and is careful to interpret the results in the context of the individual's clinical presentation and family history.
