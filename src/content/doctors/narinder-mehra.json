His key procedures would likely include:\n\n*   **Histocompatibility Testing (HLA Typing and Antibody Screening):** This is a cornerstone of transplant immunology. Dr. Mehra would be proficient in performing and interpreting HLA typing, which identifies the genetic markers on cells that determine compatibility between a donor and recipient. He would also be skilled in antibody screening, which detects the presence of antibodies in the recipient's blood that could react against the donor organ and lead to rejection. He would use sophisticated techniques like flow cytometry, ELISA, and molecular assays to perform these tests.\n*   **Crossmatching:** This procedure involves mixing the recipient's serum with donor cells to determine if pre-existing antibodies will react against the donor organ. A positive crossmatch indicates a high risk of hyperacute rejection and would generally contraindicate transplantation. Dr. Mehra would meticulously analyze crossmatch results to assess the immunological risk and guide transplant decisions.\n*   **Immunosuppressive Therapy Management:** This is perhaps the most crucial aspect of Dr. Mehra's clinical practice. He would be an expert in the use of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. He would be familiar with a wide range of immunosuppressants, including calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus), mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus, everolimus), antimetabolites (e.g., azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil), and corticosteroids. He would tailor the immunosuppressive regimen to each patient's individual needs, taking into account factors such as the type of organ transplanted, the patient's immunological risk, and the presence of co-morbidities. He would also closely monitor patients for side effects of immunosuppressive therapy and adjust the regimen accordingly.\n*   **Diagnosis and Management of Rejection Episodes:** Despite immunosuppressive therapy, rejection episodes can still occur. Dr. Mehra would be adept at diagnosing different types of rejection, including acute cellular rejection, antibody-mediated rejection, and chronic rejection. He would use a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests (e.g., serum creatinine, liver function tests), and biopsy results to diagnose rejection. He would then initiate appropriate treatment, which may involve increasing the dose of immunosuppressants, adding new immunosuppressants, or using antibody therapies to deplete or block the activity of immune cells.\n*   **Management of Transplant-Related Complications:** Dr. Mehra would also be involved in the management of various complications that can arise after transplantation, such as infections, malignancies, and cardiovascular disease. He would work closely with other specialists to provide comprehensive care for these patients. He would be particularly vigilant for opportunistic infections, which are common in immunosuppressed individuals.\n\nHis specialization also likely includes expertise in desensitization protocols for highly sensitized patients (those with a high level of pre-existing antibodies against potential donor organs). This may involve plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and other immunomodulatory therapies.\n\n## 4. Academic Contributions & Research\n\nWhile specific publications attributed to Dr. Mehra are not available, it is highly probable that he has contributed to the field of transplant immunology through research and scholarly activities.
