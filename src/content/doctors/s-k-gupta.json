He would also be open to participating in clinical trials and research studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new treatments.\n\n## 3. Key Procedures & Clinical Expertise\n\nAs a corneal surgeon, Dr. Gupta possesses a highly specialized skillset focused on the diagnosis and surgical management of corneal diseases and disorders. The cornea, being the clear front surface of the eye, plays a crucial role in focusing light and providing clear vision. Damage or disease affecting the cornea can lead to significant visual impairment and discomfort.\n\nDr. Gupta's clinical expertise likely encompasses a wide range of corneal procedures, including:\n\n*   **Corneal Transplantation:** This involves replacing a damaged or diseased cornea with a healthy donor cornea. He would be proficient in performing various types of corneal transplants, such as penetrating keratoplasty (PK), which involves replacing the full thickness of the cornea, and lamellar keratoplasty, which involves replacing only the affected layers of the cornea. Specific lamellar techniques he might specialize in include Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSAEK) and Descemet's Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK), both used to treat endothelial dysfunction.\n*   **Refractive Surgery:** While not strictly corneal disease treatment, refractive surgery often involves reshaping the cornea to correct refractive errors such as myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and astigmatism. Dr. Gupta might perform procedures such as LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis), PRK (photorefractive keratectomy), and SMILE (small incision lenticule extraction).\n*   **Corneal Cross-linking:** This procedure is used to strengthen the cornea in patients with keratoconus, a progressive thinning and bulging of the cornea. It involves applying riboflavin (vitamin B2) to the cornea and then exposing it to ultraviolet (UV) light, which creates cross-links between collagen fibers, making the cornea more rigid.\n*   **Pterygium Excision:** A pterygium is a growth of tissue that extends onto the cornea from the conjunctiva. Dr. Gupta would be skilled in surgically removing pterygia and employing techniques such as conjunctival autografts to prevent recurrence.\n*   **Corneal Ulcer Management:** Corneal ulcers are open sores on the cornea that can be caused by infection, trauma, or dry eye. Dr. Gupta would be adept at diagnosing and treating corneal ulcers with antibiotics, antifungals, or antiviral medications, as well as performing surgical procedures such as corneal scraping or debridement to remove infected tissue.\n*   **Keratoprosthesis Implantation:** In cases of severe corneal damage where traditional corneal transplantation is not feasible, Dr. Gupta may perform keratoprosthesis implantation, which involves replacing the cornea with an artificial cornea.\n\nHis expertise would also extend to managing complications associated with corneal surgery, such as infection, rejection, and wound healing problems.\n\n## 4.
