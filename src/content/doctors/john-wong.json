This involves meticulous attention to detail and a thorough understanding of cancer biology. He would perform or oversee biopsies (needle, incisional, excisional) to obtain tissue samples for diagnosis.\n*   **Chemotherapy Administration and Management:** Skilled in selecting appropriate chemotherapy regimens based on the type and stage of cancer, as well as the patient's overall health and tolerance. He would be adept at managing the side effects of chemotherapy, such as nausea, fatigue, and hair loss, using supportive medications and therapies. This requires a deep understanding of pharmacology and the potential toxicities of various chemotherapeutic agents.\n*   **Targeted Therapy and Immunotherapy:** Experienced in utilizing targeted therapies that specifically target cancer cells, as well as immunotherapies that boost the body's immune system to fight cancer. He would be knowledgeable about the mechanisms of action of these therapies and their potential side effects, carefully monitoring patients for immune-related adverse events.\n*   **Radiation Therapy Planning and Coordination:** Collaborates closely with radiation oncologists to develop comprehensive treatment plans that incorporate radiation therapy when indicated. He would be knowledgeable about the different types of radiation therapy and their potential side effects, ensuring that patients receive the appropriate radiation dose while minimizing damage to healthy tissues.\n*   **Hormonal Therapy:** Prescribing and managing hormonal therapies for hormone-sensitive cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer. This requires a thorough understanding of the endocrine system and the role of hormones in cancer development and progression.\n*   **Bone Marrow Biopsies and Aspirations:** Performing bone marrow biopsies and aspirations to diagnose and monitor hematologic malignancies, such as leukemia and lymphoma. This requires technical skill and precision to obtain adequate samples for analysis.\n*   **Pain Management and Palliative Care:** Providing comprehensive pain management and palliative care to improve the quality of life for patients with advanced cancer. This involves a multidisciplinary approach, working with other healthcare professionals to address the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of patients and their families.\n*   **Management of Cancer-Related Complications:** Skilled in managing the various complications that can arise from cancer and its treatment, such as infections, anemia, and blood clots.
