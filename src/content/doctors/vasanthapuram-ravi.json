He is proficient in performing and interpreting a wide range of diagnostic procedures, including:\n\n*   **Lumbar puncture:** Dr. Ravi is highly skilled in performing lumbar punctures to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis. He meticulously analyzes the CSF for evidence of viral infection, including elevated white blood cell counts, increased protein levels, and the presence of viral nucleic acid or antibodies.\n*   **Neuroimaging:** He expertly interprets neuroimaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, to identify characteristic patterns of brain inflammation and to rule out other potential causes of neurological symptoms. He is particularly adept at recognizing the subtle neuroimaging findings associated with different types of viral encephalitis.\n*   **Electroencephalography (EEG):** Dr. Ravi utilizes EEG to assess brain electrical activity in patients with suspected viral encephalitis. He is skilled in identifying characteristic EEG patterns associated with seizures and other neurological abnormalities.\n*   **Molecular diagnostics:** He leverages advanced molecular diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to rapidly and accurately identify the specific viral agent causing the infection. This allows for targeted antiviral therapy to be initiated as soon as possible.\n\nIn terms of treatment, Dr. Ravi is experienced in managing the various complications associated with viral encephalitis, including seizures, coma, and long-term neurological sequelae. He is proficient in administering antiviral medications, such as acyclovir for herpes simplex encephalitis, and in providing supportive care to optimize patient outcomes. He also emphasizes the importance of rehabilitation therapy to help patients recover from neurological deficits.\n\nWhile the location of his private practice is unknown, it is safe to assume that his expertise in neurovirology makes him a highly sought-after consultant for complex cases of viral encephalitis. His reputation for accurate diagnosis and effective management extends beyond his immediate practice, attracting referrals from other physicians seeking his specialized knowledge.\n\n## 4.
