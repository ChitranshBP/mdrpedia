  "biography": "The National Research and Innovation Agency is a cabinet-level agency of the Indonesian government, formed in 2019. Originally a new agency attached to the Ministry of Research and Technology, which became the Ministry of Research and Technology/National Research and Innovation Agency, the agency was controversially separated and established as a new non-ministerial government agency directly under the President of Indonesia on 28 April 2021. On 23 August 2021, the agency gained cabinet-level status through enactment of Presidential Decree No. 78/2021. Under the new presidential regulation, it became the sole national research agency of Indonesia.",
