  "biography": "Elizabeth Helen Blackburn (born 1948) is an Australian-American molecular biologist who won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for co-discovering the enzyme telomerase. Born in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, she earned her BSc and MSc in Biochemistry from the University of Melbourne and her PhD in Molecular Biology from the University of Cambridge, where she worked with Frederick Sanger. After postdoctoral research at Yale, she joined UC Berkeley in 1978 and moved to UC San Francisco in 1990. In 1984, working with her graduate student Carol Greider, she discovered telomerase — the enzyme that maintains the DNA at chromosome ends (telomeres) and counteracts their shortening during cell division. This discovery has profound implications for understanding aging, cancer, and cellular longevity. Blackburn co-authored 'The Telomere Effect' (2017), translating her research for a general audience.",
