  "biography": "Thomas Earl Starzl (1926–2017) was an American physician widely recognized as the 'father of modern transplantation.' He performed the first human liver transplant in 1963 and the first successful liver transplant in 1967 at the University of Colorado. With over 2,200 publications, he was identified by the Institute for Scientific Information as the most cited author in the history of clinical medicine. Starzl pioneered the clinical use of cyclosporine (1982) and tacrolimus/FK506 (1989), immunosuppressive agents that revolutionized organ transplantation survival rates. He moved to the University of Pittsburgh in 1981, where he led the world's largest transplant program. His memoir, 'The Puzzle People' (1992), chronicles his surgical career and scientific discoveries.",
