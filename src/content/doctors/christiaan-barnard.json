  "biography": "Christiaan Neethling Barnard (1922–2001) was a South African cardiac surgeon who performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant on 3 December 1967 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. The patient, Louis Washkansky, received the heart of Denise Darvall, a 25-year-old accident victim. Barnard earned his MD from the University of Cape Town and later studied under C. Walton Lillehei at the University of Minnesota, where he learned open-heart surgery techniques. He went on to develop the heterotopic ('piggyback') heart transplant technique in 1974, where a donor heart is placed alongside the patient's own heart — a procedure still used today for certain patients.",
