He was a Hindu priest of the Shaiva sect who was born in Java during the final period of the Majapahit Kingdom and spent most of his life, until his death, in Bali. In Bali, he was appointed as Bagawanta or royal priest in the Gelgel Kingdom. In the manuscript Paniti Gama Tirta Pawitra, he is also depicted as Sang Atungga Dharma or a wandering sage who spread the teachings of dharma. He was also known as a renowned poet and literary figure. He is regarded as the most influential reformer of Balinese Hinduism, and his religious legacy is still practiced in various regions across Indonesia. He is also believed to be the founder of the teachings of Tarekat Watu Telu.",
