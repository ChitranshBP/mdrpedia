He then utilizes a range of genetic testing techniques, including:\n\n*   **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):** Dr. Weinberger leverages the power of NGS to analyze large portions of the genome, identifying single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions, deletions, and copy number variations that may contribute to neurological disorders. This includes whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for complex cases where the underlying genetic cause is unknown.\n*   **Targeted Gene Panels:** For patients with specific clinical features suggestive of a particular genetic disorder, he employs targeted gene panels that focus on sequencing genes known to be associated with that condition. This approach is more efficient and cost-effective than WES or WGS when a specific diagnosis is suspected.\n*   **Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA):** This technique is used to detect chromosomal abnormalities, such as deletions, duplications, and translocations, which can cause a variety of neurological and developmental disorders.\n*   **Mitochondrial DNA Sequencing:** Dr. Weinberger is proficient in sequencing mitochondrial DNA to diagnose mitochondrial disorders, which can affect the brain, muscles, and other organs.\n*   **Fragile X Syndrome Testing:** He performs this test to diagnose Fragile X syndrome, a common cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.\n\nBeyond diagnostic testing, Dr. Weinberger provides comprehensive genetic counseling to patients and their families. He explains the implications of genetic test results, discusses recurrence risks, and helps families make informed decisions about reproductive options. He also connects patients with support groups and other resources to help them cope with the challenges of living with a genetic neurological disorder.\n\nHis clinical expertise extends to a wide range of neurological disorders with a genetic component, including:\n\n*   **Neurodegenerative diseases:** Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and frontotemporal dementia. He stays at the forefront of research identifying novel genetic risk factors and potential therapeutic targets for these devastating conditions.\n*   **Epilepsy:** He diagnoses and manages genetic epilepsies, including Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex.\n*   **Neuromuscular disorders:** Spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy.\n*   **Autism spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders:** He plays a crucial role in identifying genetic causes of these complex conditions, which can inform diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.\n*   **Hereditary neuropathies:** Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and other inherited nerve disorders.\n\n## 4.
