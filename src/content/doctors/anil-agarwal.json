Pant Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education & Research (GIPMER), New Delhi. He is widely recognized for his expertise in complex hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeries, particularly for <strong>Gallbladder Cancer (GBC)</strong>, a disease with high prevalence in North India.</p><h3>Education and Training</h3><p>Dr. Agarwal completed his surgical training at some of India's finest institutions, obtaining his MCh in GI Surgery. He further honed his skills with fellowships in the UK (FRCS) and USA (FACS), bringing global best practices to the public healthcare system in India.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>At G.B. Pant Hospital, Dr. Agarwal has built one of the highest-volume GI surgery centers in the country. He has been a vocal advocate for establishing GI Surgery as a distinct super-specialty, distinct from general surgery, to ensure better outcomes for complex cancers.</p><h3>Key Contributions & Innovations</h3><ul><li><strong>Gallbladder Cancer Protocols:</strong> His team has published some of the largest series on the radical resection of gallbladder cancer, defining the extent of hepatectomy and lymphadenectomy required for optimal survival.</li><li><strong>Whipple's Procedure:</strong> He is known for his proficiency in the Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) and has introduced modifications to reduce postoperative fistula rates.</li><li><strong>Cost-Effective Care:</strong> Working in a government teaching hospital, he has developed cost-effective surgical protocols that make high-end cancer care accessible to the indigent population.</li></ul><h3>Awards and Recognition</h3><ul><li><strong>Dr. B.C. Roy Award</strong> (Nominee/Recipient in specialty category).</li><li>President of the <strong>Indian Association of Surgical Gastroenterology (IASG)</strong>.</li><li>Member of the Editorial Board for the <em>Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery</em>.</li></ul><h3>Legacy</h3><p>Dr. Agarwal is a mentor to a generation of GI surgeons. His academic rigor works to ensure that G.B. Pant remains a beacon of hope for patients with complex abdominal malignancies. He has authored over 150 peer-reviewed papers, significantly contributing to the literature on tropical gastroenterology and hepatobiliary oncology.</p>",
