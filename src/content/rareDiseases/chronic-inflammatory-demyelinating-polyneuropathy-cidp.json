    "description": "Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare acquired immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system. It is characterized by progressive symmetric weakness and impaired sensory function in the arms and legs. Unlike its acute counterpart, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), CIDP has a chronic course, progressing for at least 8 weeks. The condition results from damage to the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers, leading to impaired nerve conduction and neurological dysfunction.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body's wires (nerves) are covered in a protective coating. In CIDP, your body's defense system mistakenly attacks this coating, making it hard for signals to travel along the wires. This causes weakness and numbness, especially in your arms and legs. Doctors can give you medicine to calm down your defense system and protect the wires.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an acquired immune-mediated disorder of the peripheral nervous system characterized by progressive, symmetric proximal and distal weakness and sensory dysfunction persisting for at least 8 weeks. Pathologically, it involves demyelination and inflammation of peripheral nerves and nerve roots. Diagnostic criteria include clinical features, electrodiagnostic findings consistent with demyelination (e.g., conduction block, prolonged distal latencies, slowed conduction velocities), elevated CSF protein, and exclusion of other causes of neuropathy. Treatment strategies aim to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation, commonly employing IVIg, plasmapheresis, or corticosteroids. Long-term management often involves maintenance therapy to prevent relapses and supportive care to optimize functional abilities.",
    "historicalBackground": "CIDP was first described as a distinct entity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, differentiating it from the more acute Guillain-Barré syndrome. The recognition of its chronic and relapsing nature led to the development of specific diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches.",
