    "description": "Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder characterized by defective bone mineralization. This defect results from a deficiency of the enzyme tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). The severity of HPP varies widely, ranging from stillbirth without mineralized bone to pathological fractures in adulthood. Clinical manifestations primarily affect the skeleton and teeth, but can also involve other organ systems.",

    "clinicalSummary": "Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a heritable disorder of bone mineralization caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ALPL gene, encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is crucial for bone mineralization by hydrolyzing phosphate substrates, including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a mineralization inhibitor. Reduced TNSALP activity leads to PPi accumulation, impaired hydroxyapatite crystal formation, and defective bone and tooth mineralization. Clinical presentation varies widely, ranging from severe perinatal forms with skeletal hypomineralization and respiratory failure to milder adult forms with stress fractures and dental abnormalities. Diagnosis involves assessing serum ALP levels, genetic testing, and radiographic evaluation. Enzyme replacement therapy with asfotase alfa has significantly improved outcomes, particularly in severe infantile-onset HPP.",
    "historicalBackground": "Hypophosphatasia was first described by Dr. John Campbell Rathbun in 1948 in a Canadian pediatrician journal. He described a severe form of the disease in a young infant. Further research elucidated the role of alkaline phosphatase and the genetic basis of the condition.",
