    "description": "Apert syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniosynostosis (premature fusion of certain skull bones) and syndactyly (fusion) of the fingers and toes. The severity of these features can vary among affected individuals. Other common features include midface hypoplasia, which can lead to breathing and feeding difficulties, as well as dental abnormalities and intellectual disability in some cases.",

    "eli5Summary": "Apert syndrome is when a baby's skull bones fuse too early, and their fingers and toes are often fused together. Doctors can do surgery to help fix these problems so the child can grow and develop better.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Apert syndrome (ACS1) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, and syndactyly of the hands and feet. The underlying pathology involves mutations in the FGFR2 gene, leading to constitutive activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway, resulting in premature osteoblast differentiation and fusion of cranial sutures. Clinical manifestations include a turribrachycephalic skull shape, shallow orbits, proptosis, choanal stenosis, and variable degrees of intellectual disability. Diagnosis is typically made clinically and confirmed by genetic testing. Management involves a multidisciplinary approach, including staged surgical procedures to address craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, and syndactyly. Long-term follow-up is essential to monitor for complications such as increased intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus, and airway obstruction.",
    "historicalBackground": "Apert syndrome was first described in detail by French physician Eugène Apert in 1906. He characterized the condition based on the distinct combination of craniosynostosis and syndactyly observed in affected individuals.",
