    "description": "Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome (BRBNS) is a rare disorder characterized by the presence of multiple, distinctive, bluish-purple, rubbery, cutaneous (skin) lesions known as blebs, along with vascular malformations that can affect various organs, most commonly the gastrointestinal tract. These lesions can cause pain, bleeding, and anemia. The severity and location of the lesions vary greatly among affected individuals.",

    "clinicalSummary": "Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome (BRBNS) is a rare systemic vascular anomaly characterized by distinctive cutaneous and visceral venous malformations. The cutaneous lesions, or blebs, are typically compressible, bluish-purple nodules that vary in size and number. Gastrointestinal involvement is common, leading to chronic blood loss, iron deficiency anemia, and, in severe cases, protein-losing enteropathy. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, imaging studies (MRI, CT), and endoscopic procedures to identify and assess the extent of visceral lesions. Management focuses on symptomatic relief, including iron supplementation, blood transfusions, and endoscopic or surgical intervention to control bleeding. Medical therapies such as sirolimus and octreotide have shown some promise in reducing lesion size and bleeding. Genetic testing may be considered in familial cases to identify potential underlying mutations.",
    "historicalBackground": "The first detailed description of Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome was provided by William Bean in 1958, who characterized the distinctive cutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease.",
