    "description": "Crouzon syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis). This early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face. Facial features can include shallow eye sockets, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), a small upper jaw (maxillary hypoplasia), and a beak-shaped nose. In some cases, Crouzon syndrome is also associated with hydrocephalus and hearing loss.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your head is like a puzzle, and the pieces (skull bones) fuse together too early. This can make your head and face grow in a different shape. Doctors can do surgery to help the puzzle pieces grow correctly and make sure you can see and hear well.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Crouzon syndrome is a craniofacial dysostosis resulting from mutations in the FGFR2 gene, leading to premature fusion of cranial sutures. This craniosynostosis results in characteristic facial features including brachycephaly, midface hypoplasia, shallow orbits with proptosis, and hypertelorism. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, although sporadic cases also occur. Diagnosis is typically made clinically and confirmed through genetic testing. Management involves a multidisciplinary approach, with surgical intervention to address craniosynostosis and facial deformities. Potential complications include increased intracranial pressure, vision impairment, and obstructive sleep apnea. Long-term follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence of craniosynostosis and to manage associated medical issues.",
    "historicalBackground": "Crouzon syndrome was first described by French physician Octave Crouzon in 1912. He documented the condition in a mother and son, noting the characteristic craniofacial features associated with the syndrome.",
