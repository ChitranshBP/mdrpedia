    "description": "Glycogen storage disease (GSD) is a group of inherited metabolic disorders caused by defects in enzymes that regulate the synthesis or breakdown of glycogen. These defects lead to abnormal accumulation or deficiency of glycogen in various tissues, primarily the liver and muscles, resulting in a wide range of clinical manifestations depending on the specific enzyme deficiency.",

    "clinicalSummary": "Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by defects in enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis or degradation. These defects lead to abnormal glycogen accumulation or deficiency in various tissues, most commonly the liver and muscle. Clinical manifestations vary depending on the specific enzyme deficiency and the affected tissues. Common symptoms include hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, and growth retardation. Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical evaluation, biochemical testing (blood and urine), enzyme assays, and genetic testing. Management focuses on dietary modifications to maintain stable blood glucose levels, enzyme replacement therapy (for some types), and supportive care to address specific complications. Prognosis varies widely depending on the type and severity of GSD.",
    "historicalBackground": "The first description of glycogen storage disease was by von Gierke in 1929, who identified a patient with hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia due to a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase. Subsequent research led to the identification of other enzyme deficiencies involved in glycogen metabolism, leading to the classification of different types of GSD.",
