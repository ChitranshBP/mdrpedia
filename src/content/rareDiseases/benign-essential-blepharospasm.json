    "description": "Benign Essential Blepharospasm (BEB) is a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary, forceful, and repetitive contractions of the muscles around the eyes, leading to involuntary blinking or eyelid closure. It is considered 'benign' because it is not life-threatening, and 'essential' because the cause is unknown (idiopathic).",

    "clinicalSummary": "Benign Essential Blepharospasm (BEB) is a focal dystonia characterized by involuntary, repetitive contractions of the orbicularis oculi, procerus, and corrugator muscles. The pathophysiology is not fully understood, but is believed to involve dysfunction in the basal ganglia. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on observation of characteristic symptoms and exclusion of secondary causes. Treatment focuses on symptomatic relief, primarily with botulinum toxin injections. In severe cases, surgical myectomy may be considered. The condition is chronic and can significantly impair vision and quality of life.",
    "historicalBackground": "The first detailed description of blepharospasm was provided in the late 19th century. The term 'benign essential blepharospasm' was coined to differentiate it from other forms of eyelid spasms. Botulinum toxin injections were introduced as a treatment in the 1980s and have since become the standard of care.",
