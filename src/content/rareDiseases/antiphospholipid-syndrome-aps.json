    "description": "Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the blood, which leads to an increased risk of blood clots (thrombosis) in arteries and veins, as well as pregnancy complications such as recurrent miscarriages, premature births, and stillbirths. APS can occur as a primary condition or in association with other autoimmune diseases, most notably systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body's security system is confused and starts attacking your own blood, making it sticky and causing clots. This can lead to problems like strokes, miscarriages, and other health issues. Doctors use special medicines to thin your blood and prevent these clots.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) directed against phospholipid-binding plasma proteins. These antibodies lead to a hypercoagulable state, resulting in arterial and venous thrombosis, as well as pregnancy morbidity. The diagnosis requires the presence of at least one clinical criterion (vascular thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity) and one laboratory criterion (positive aPL antibodies on at least two occasions, 12 weeks apart). Management focuses on anticoagulation to prevent recurrent thrombotic events and specific strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes. Catastrophic APS (CAPS) is a rare and life-threatening variant characterized by multiple organ involvement and requires aggressive immunosuppressive and antithrombotic therapy.",
    "historicalBackground": "Antiphospholipid antibodies were first described in the context of false-positive syphilis serological tests in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In 1983, Dr. Graham Hughes recognized the association between these antibodies and thrombosis and pregnancy complications, leading to the formal description of antiphospholipid syndrome.",
