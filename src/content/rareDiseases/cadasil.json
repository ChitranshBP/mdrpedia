    "description": "CADASIL is a hereditary stroke disorder caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. It leads to thickening of blood vessel walls, reducing blood flow to the brain and causing a variety of neurological symptoms, including migraine with aura, recurrent stroke, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances. The condition typically manifests in adulthood and progresses over time.",

    "eli5Summary": "CADASIL is like having tiny problems in the pipes that bring blood to your brain. These problems can cause headaches, make it hard to think clearly, and sometimes cause strokes. It's something you can get from your parents, and doctors can help manage the symptoms.",
    "clinicalSummary": "CADASIL is a systemic arteriopathy caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, leading to accumulation of NOTCH3 extracellular domain (N3ECD) in the walls of small- to medium-sized arteries. This accumulation results in thickening of the vessel walls and reduced cerebral blood flow, leading to ischemic events. Clinically, CADASIL presents with migraine with aura, recurrent stroke or TIA, cognitive impairment progressing to dementia, and psychiatric disturbances. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations and can be supported by skin biopsy showing GOM deposits. MRI findings include characteristic white matter hyperintensities, particularly in the anterior temporal lobes and external capsules. Management is primarily symptomatic, focusing on stroke prevention and management of associated symptoms.",
    "historicalBackground": "CADASIL was first described in 1977 by Marie-Germaine Bousser and colleagues in a French family. The genetic basis of the disease, mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, was identified in 1996 by Elisabeth Tournier-Lasserve's group.",
