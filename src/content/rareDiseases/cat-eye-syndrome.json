    "description": "Cat Eye Syndrome (CES) is a rare genetic disorder caused by a partial trisomy or tetrasomy of chromosome 22, specifically involving the 22pter-q11 region. It is characterized by a wide range of congenital malformations, most commonly affecting the eyes (coloboma), ears, heart, and kidneys. The severity of symptoms varies greatly among affected individuals.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body has instructions to build itself, like a Lego set. Cat Eye Syndrome happens when there's an extra little piece of one of the instructions (chromosome 22). This extra piece can cause problems with how your eyes, ears, heart, and other body parts are built, making them a little different.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Cat Eye Syndrome (CES) is a rare, multiple congenital anomaly syndrome resulting from partial trisomy or tetrasomy of chromosome 22pter-q11. The duplicated region contains the *CECR1* gene (also known as *ADA2*), among others. The clinical phenotype is highly variable, ranging from individuals with minimal clinical findings to those with severe, life-threatening malformations. The most consistent features include coloboma of the iris (often giving the appearance of a 'cat eye'), anal atresia with or without fistula, preauricular skin tags or pits, and downslanting palpebral fissures. Other common features include congenital heart defects (especially total anomalous pulmonary venous return), renal anomalies, skeletal abnormalities, and mild to moderate intellectual disability. Diagnosis is typically made through chromosomal analysis (karyotyping, FISH, or CMA). Management is focused on addressing the specific malformations present in each individual through surgical correction, supportive care, and developmental therapies. Genetic counseling is essential for families with an affected individual.",
    "historicalBackground": "Cat Eye Syndrome was first described in the medical literature in the late 1960s. The term 'Cat Eye Syndrome' was coined due to the characteristic iris coloboma observed in many affected individuals. The underlying genetic cause, involving partial trisomy/tetrasomy of chromosome 22, was later identified through advancements in cytogenetic techniques.",

            "description": "Research has highlighted the role of the CECR1/ADA2 gene, located in the critical region of chromosome 22q11, in the pathogenesis of Cat Eye Syndrome. Mutations in this gene have been linked to vasculopathy and inflammation, providing insights into the diverse clinical manifestations of the syndrome.",
