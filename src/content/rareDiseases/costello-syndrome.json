    "eli5Summary": "Costello Syndrome is a rare problem kids are born with. It makes them look a little different, learn slower, and sometimes have heart problems. Doctors help them grow and stay healthy.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Costello syndrome is a rare RASopathy caused by heterozygous mutations in the HRAS gene. The syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features, cardiac abnormalities (particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), cutaneous papillomata, musculoskeletal abnormalities, neurocognitive delays, and an increased predisposition to certain malignancies, notably rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma. Diagnosis is typically made clinically and confirmed by genetic testing. Management involves multidisciplinary care, including cardiology, dermatology, developmental pediatrics, and oncology. Surveillance for tumor development is crucial. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of cardiac and oncologic complications.",
    "historicalBackground": "Costello syndrome was first described by Dr. John Costello in 1977. The genetic basis of the syndrome, mutations in the HRAS gene, was identified in 2004.",
