    "description": "CHARGE syndrome is a rare, complex genetic disorder characterized by a specific pattern of congenital anomalies. The acronym CHARGE stands for Coloboma, Heart defects, Atresia of the choanae, Retardation of growth and/or development, Genital and/or urinary abnormalities, and Ear abnormalities and deafness. However, not every child with CHARGE syndrome has all of these features. The severity and combination of features can vary significantly among affected individuals.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine a puzzle where some important pieces are missing. CHARGE syndrome is like that, but instead of puzzle pieces, it's about missing or not-quite-right parts of the body, like the eyes, heart, nose, ears, and private parts. It can make it hard to see, hear, breathe, grow, and learn.",
    "clinicalSummary": "CHARGE syndrome is a complex genetic disorder primarily caused by mutations in the CHD7 gene. This gene plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. The clinical presentation is highly variable, but the acronym CHARGE is a useful mnemonic for the most common features: Coloboma (typically retinal), Heart defects (conotruncal abnormalities), Choanal atresia, Retardation of growth and development, Genital hypoplasia, and Ear anomalies (sensorineural or mixed hearing loss, structural abnormalities). Cranial nerve involvement is common, leading to feeding difficulties, facial palsy, and swallowing dysfunction. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and confirmed by genetic testing. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach, including surgical correction of congenital anomalies, supportive care, and developmental therapies.",
    "historicalBackground": "CHARGE syndrome was first described as a distinct entity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The acronym CHARGE was proposed by Pagon et al. in 1981 to describe the constellation of findings. The identification of CHD7 as the major causative gene in 2004 significantly advanced our understanding of the syndrome's etiology.",
