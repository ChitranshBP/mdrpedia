    "description": "Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth failure, impaired neurological development, sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity), and premature aging. It is caused by mutations in genes involved in DNA repair, specifically the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway.",

    "eli5Summary": "Cockayne Syndrome is a rare disease where kids grow slowly, are very sensitive to the sun, and have problems with their brains. It's like they're aging too fast. Doctors can help with some of the problems, but there's no cure.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defects in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). Mutations in ERCC6 (CSB) and ERCC8 (CSA) are the most common causes. Clinically, CS presents with growth failure, progressive neurological dysfunction, photosensitivity, and premature aging. Diagnostic features include impaired growth, microcephaly, cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, and skeletal abnormalities. Neuropathological findings include demyelination and calcification of the basal ganglia. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing or cellular assays demonstrating defective TC-NER. Management is primarily supportive, focusing on symptom management and preventing complications. Prognosis is poor, with reduced lifespan and significant morbidity.",
    "historicalBackground": "Cockayne syndrome was first described in 1936 by Edward Alfred Cockayne, an English physician, who reported two siblings with the characteristic features of the disease.",
