    "description": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a group of inherited disorders that affect the peripheral nerves. These nerves carry signals from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles and sensory receptors throughout the body. CMT primarily affects the nerves in the arms and legs, leading to muscle weakness, atrophy, and sensory loss. Symptoms typically begin in adolescence or early adulthood, but can appear at any age. CMT is a progressive disease, meaning symptoms worsen over time, but most individuals with CMT have a normal life expectancy.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body has wires (nerves) that help your muscles move and feel things. In CMT, some of these wires are damaged, especially in your legs and feet. This makes it hard to walk and you might not feel things as well. It's like having a weak signal on your phone, making it hard to hear the other person.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited peripheral neuropathies characterized by progressive motor and sensory deficits. The underlying pathology involves demyelination or axonal degeneration of peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness, atrophy, and sensory loss, predominantly in the distal extremities. Genetic mutations in genes encoding myelin proteins, axonal transport proteins, and mitochondrial proteins are implicated. Clinical presentation varies widely depending on the specific genetic mutation and disease subtype. Diagnosis involves neurological examination, electrophysiological studies (nerve conduction velocity and EMG), and genetic testing to identify the causative mutation. Management focuses on supportive care, including physical and occupational therapy, orthotics, and pain management. Gene therapy and targeted pharmacological interventions are under investigation.",
    "historicalBackground": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease was first described in 1886 by Jean-Martin Charcot, Pierre Marie, and Howard Henry Tooth, who independently reported the condition.",
