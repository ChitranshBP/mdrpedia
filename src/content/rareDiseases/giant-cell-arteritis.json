    "description": "Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of large and medium-sized arteries, predominantly affecting branches of the aortic arch, especially the temporal arteries. It is characterized by granulomatous inflammation and intimal thickening, leading to vessel stenosis or occlusion. GCA typically affects individuals over the age of 50 and is often associated with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).",

    "eli5Summary": "Giant cell arteritis is like when the pipes (blood vessels) in your head get swollen and angry, causing headaches and sometimes vision problems. Doctors give medicine to calm them down.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a systemic vasculitis affecting large and medium-sized arteries, particularly the branches of the aortic arch. The pathogenesis involves an inflammatory cascade initiated by dendritic cells and macrophages, leading to granuloma formation and intimal hyperplasia. Clinically, GCA presents with headache, temporal artery tenderness, jaw claudication, and visual disturbances. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), and confirmation by temporal artery biopsy. Treatment primarily involves high-dose corticosteroids, often followed by steroid-sparing agents like methotrexate or tocilizumab to minimize long-term steroid exposure and relapse risk. Complications include irreversible vision loss, aortic aneurysm, and stroke.",
    "historicalBackground": "Giant cell arteritis was first described by Jonathan Hutchinson in 1890. Horton et al. provided a detailed pathological description in 1932, leading to the alternative name 'Horton's arteritis.' The association with polymyalgia rheumatica was recognized later, highlighting the systemic nature of the disease.",
