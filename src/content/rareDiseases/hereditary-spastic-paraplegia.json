    "description": "Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited neurological disorders characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness (spasticity) of the legs. This condition results from dysfunction of the long corticospinal tracts, which control voluntary movement. HSP can be classified as either 'pure' or 'complex', depending on whether additional neurological symptoms are present.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your legs have a hard time listening to your brain, making them stiff and weak. That's like Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia. It's a problem with the wires (nerves) that tell your legs what to do, and it can make walking difficult.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited neurological disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness primarily affecting the lower limbs. The underlying pathophysiology involves degeneration of the corticospinal tracts, leading to upper motor neuron dysfunction. HSP is classified into pure and complex forms based on the presence or absence of additional neurological features. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, neuroimaging to rule out other conditions, and genetic testing to identify causative mutations. Management focuses on symptomatic relief, including medications for spasticity, physical therapy to maintain mobility, and assistive devices. Research is ongoing to develop targeted therapies, including gene therapy, for specific HSP subtypes.",
    "historicalBackground": "The first detailed description of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia is attributed to Adolph Strümpell in the late 19th century, followed by Ernest Lorrain, hence the historical name Strümpell-Lorrain disease. Subsequent research has identified numerous genetic mutations associated with different forms of HSP, leading to a better understanding of its diverse etiologies and clinical presentations.",
