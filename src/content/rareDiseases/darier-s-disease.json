    "description": "Darier's disease (DD) is a rare autosomal dominant skin disorder characterized by persistent, greasy, and scaling papules and plaques on the seborrheic areas of the body, such as the chest, back, scalp, and flexures. It is caused by mutations in the ATP2A2 gene, which encodes a calcium pump in the endoplasmic reticulum.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your skin has trouble sticking together properly. Darier's Disease is like having tiny, rough bumps all over your body, especially where you sweat a lot. It can be itchy and sometimes smelly, but doctors can help you manage it with creams and medicines.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Darier's disease (DD) is a genodermatosis caused by mutations in ATP2A2, encoding the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase isoform 2 (SERCA2). This leads to impaired calcium signaling and disrupted keratinocyte adhesion and differentiation. Clinically, DD presents with keratotic papules in seborrheic areas, nail abnormalities, and sometimes neuropsychiatric manifestations. Histopathology reveals acantholysis and dyskeratosis with corps ronds and grains. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing. Management includes topical and systemic retinoids, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and supportive measures. The disease course is chronic with variable severity and exacerbations triggered by heat, sunlight, and stress.",
    "historicalBackground": "Darier's disease was first described by French dermatologist Ferdinand-Jean Darier in 1889. He characterized the distinct skin lesions and histological features of the condition, establishing it as a unique dermatological entity.",
