    "description": "Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare genetic bleeding disorder characterized by abnormally large platelets (thrombocytopenia), a reduced platelet count (thrombocytopenia), and impaired platelet function, leading to a tendency to bleed excessively. It is caused by defects in the glycoprotein Ib/IX/V complex, which is essential for platelet adhesion to damaged blood vessel walls.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your blood has tiny helpers called platelets that stop you from bleeding too much when you get a cut. In Bernard-Soulier Syndrome, these helpers are too big and don't work properly, so you might bleed more easily and for a longer time.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, giant platelets, and impaired platelet function due to defects in the glycoprotein Ib/IX/V complex. This complex mediates the initial adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium at sites of vascular injury. Mutations in the GP1BA, GP1BB, or GP9 genes, encoding subunits of the complex, lead to reduced or absent expression of the complex on the platelet surface, resulting in impaired platelet adhesion and prolonged bleeding times. Diagnosis involves CBC, peripheral blood smear, platelet aggregation studies, and flow cytometry. Management focuses on supportive care, including platelet transfusions and avoidance of antiplatelet agents. Recombinant factor VIIa and antifibrinolytic agents may be used to control bleeding episodes. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a curative option.",
    "historicalBackground": "Bernard-Soulier syndrome was first described in 1948 by French hematologists Jean Bernard and Jean-Pierre Soulier, who identified a bleeding disorder characterized by giant platelets and prolonged bleeding times in two unrelated patients.",
