    "description": "Canavan disease is a rare, progressive, inherited neurological disorder characterized by the spongy degeneration of the white matter (myelin) in the brain. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme aspartoacylase, which leads to a buildup of N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) in the brain. This accumulation disrupts normal brain development and function.",

    "eli5Summary": "Canavan disease is a rare brain problem where a part of the brain called myelin doesn't grow right. It makes it hard for kids to move, see, and learn. Doctors are trying to find better ways to help them.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Canavan disease is a leukodystrophy resulting from a deficiency in aspartoacylase, leading to elevated levels of N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) in the brain. This disrupts oligodendrocyte function and myelin formation, causing spongy degeneration of white matter. Clinically, it presents in infancy with hypotonia, macrocephaly, developmental delay, and progressive neurological decline. Diagnosis is confirmed by elevated NAA in urine, enzyme assay, and genetic testing. MRI reveals characteristic diffuse white matter abnormalities. Management is primarily supportive, with emerging gene therapy approaches showing promise.",
    "historicalBackground": "Canavan disease was first described by Myrtelle Canavan in 1931, who identified the characteristic spongy degeneration of the brain in affected individuals. The genetic basis of the disease was later elucidated, leading to improved diagnostic and potential therapeutic strategies.",
