    "description": "Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS) is a rare mitochondrial disorder characterized by progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), pigmentary retinopathy, and onset before age 20. It often involves cardiac conduction defects, cerebellar ataxia, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein. KSS results from large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).",

    "eli5Summary": "Kearns-Sayre Syndrome is a rare problem where your body's energy factories (mitochondria) don't work right. It makes your eyes droopy and causes other problems like heart issues and muscle weakness. Doctors can help manage the symptoms, but there's no cure.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS) is a mitochondrial cytopathy characterized by the triad of progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), pigmentary retinopathy, and onset before the age of 20 years. The syndrome is caused by large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Clinical manifestations commonly include cardiac conduction defects (often requiring pacemaker implantation), cerebellar ataxia, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein levels. Additional features may involve muscle weakness, short stature, hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, and renal tubular acidosis. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, electrophysiological studies, muscle biopsy with histochemical analysis, and genetic testing to identify mtDNA deletions. Management is primarily supportive, focusing on symptom relief and prevention of complications, particularly cardiac arrhythmias. Prognosis is variable and depends on the severity of organ involvement.",
    "historicalBackground": "Kearns-Sayre Syndrome was first described in 1958 by Thomas P. Kearns and George P. Sayre, who reported two patients with progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and cardiac conduction defects.",
