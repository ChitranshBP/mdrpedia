    "eli5Summary": "Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann Syndrome is a rare problem that mostly affects boys. It makes it hard for them to learn, they might have seizures, and they can get bigger breasts. They also might be shorter and a bit chubby. Doctors can help with medicine and special classes.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann Syndrome (BFLS) is a rare X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the PHF6 gene. This gene plays a crucial role in neuronal development and chromatin modification. Clinically, BFLS is characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability, epilepsy (often with onset in infancy or early childhood), gynecomastia and hypogonadism in males, characteristic facial dysmorphisms, truncal obesity, and short stature. Neurological features may include hypotonia and delayed motor milestones. Behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, aggression, and autistic features are common. Diagnosis is typically confirmed through genetic testing identifying a pathogenic variant in PHF6. Management is primarily supportive, focusing on seizure control, hormone replacement therapy, educational and behavioral interventions, and weight management. The phenotypic spectrum can vary, and females carrying the mutation may exhibit milder symptoms.",
    "historicalBackground": "Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann Syndrome was first described in 1962 by Börjeson, Forssman, and Lehmann in a Swedish family. The genetic basis of the syndrome, mutations in the PHF6 gene, was identified in 2003.",
