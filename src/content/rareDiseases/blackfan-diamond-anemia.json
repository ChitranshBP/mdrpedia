    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body has a factory that makes red blood cells, which carry oxygen. In DBA, this factory isn't working well, so you don't have enough red blood cells. This makes you tired and pale. Doctors can give you medicine or blood transfusions to help, or even give you a new factory (bone marrow transplant)!",
    "clinicalSummary": "Blackfan-Diamond anemia (DBA) is a congenital erythroid aplasia characterized by a selective deficiency of erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, resulting in macrocytic anemia. The underlying pathophysiology involves impaired ribosome biogenesis due to mutations in ribosomal protein genes. Clinical presentation typically occurs in infancy with pallor, fatigue, and poor feeding. Congenital anomalies are common, affecting the craniofacial region, upper limbs, and heart. Diagnosis is based on bone marrow examination, elevated eADA activity, and genetic testing. Treatment options include corticosteroids, red blood cell transfusions, iron chelation therapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Luspatercept is a newer treatment option. Long-term complications include iron overload, increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and certain cancers.",
    "historicalBackground": "Blackfan and Diamond independently described the disease in the 1930s, leading to its current name. The genetic basis of DBA began to be elucidated in the late 20th and early 21st centuries with the identification of mutations in ribosomal protein genes.",
