    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body sometimes makes little bumps on your skin, gets air stuck in your lungs, or grows lumps in your kidneys. Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome is when all these things can happen because of a tiny mistake in your body's instructions (genes). Doctors can help manage these problems to keep you healthy.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the FLCN gene, which encodes folliculin, a tumor suppressor protein. The syndrome is characterized by the triad of cutaneous fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts with increased risk of spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal tumors, particularly chromophobe and oncocytic hybrid tumors. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, histopathology of skin lesions, radiographic evidence of lung cysts and renal tumors, and confirmation by genetic testing. Management involves surveillance for renal tumors, treatment of pneumothorax, and symptomatic management of skin lesions. The risk of renal cancer necessitates regular monitoring and prompt intervention.",
    "historicalBackground": "Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome was first described in 1977 by Arthur Birt, Georgina Hogg, and William Dubé, who reported the association of fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons in a Canadian family.",
