    "description": "Gardner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of multiple colorectal polyps (adenomas), various types of benign and malignant tumors, and certain skeletal abnormalities. It is considered a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and is caused by mutations in the APC gene. Individuals with Gardner syndrome have a significantly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, as well as other cancers and noncancerous growths.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body is like a garden, and sometimes little weeds (polyps) grow in your tummy. Gardner Syndrome is when you get lots of these weeds, and sometimes they can turn into bigger problems. Doctors need to check your tummy often and maybe take out the weeds so you stay healthy!",
    "clinicalSummary": "Gardner syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple colorectal adenomas, osteomas (especially of the skull and mandible), epidermoid cysts, desmoid tumors, dental abnormalities, and congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). It is a phenotypic variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) caused by mutations in the APC gene. The presence of numerous colorectal polyps necessitates prophylactic colectomy to prevent colorectal cancer. Extracolonic manifestations require careful monitoring and management. Desmoid tumors, in particular, can be challenging to treat and may require surgical resection, radiation therapy, or systemic therapies. Regular screening and surveillance are crucial for early detection and management of complications.",
    "historicalBackground": "Gardner syndrome was first described by Eldon J. Gardner in 1951, who noted the association of colonic polyps with osteomas and soft tissue tumors. It was later recognized as a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) due to the shared underlying genetic cause (APC gene mutations).",
