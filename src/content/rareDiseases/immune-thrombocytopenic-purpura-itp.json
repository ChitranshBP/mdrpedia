    "description": "Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) due to the immune system attacking and destroying platelets. This can lead to increased risk of bleeding and bruising. ITP can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).",

    "eli5Summary": "Sometimes, your body's defense system gets confused and starts attacking your platelets, which are like tiny bandages in your blood. This makes you bruise and bleed more easily. Doctors can give you medicine to help your body stop attacking the platelets.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 x 10^9/L) in the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia. The underlying pathophysiology involves the production of autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoproteins, leading to increased platelet destruction by splenic macrophages and, to a lesser extent, decreased platelet production by megakaryocytes. Clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic thrombocytopenia to severe bleeding. Diagnosis is based on exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia. Treatment strategies aim to increase platelet counts and reduce bleeding risk, utilizing corticosteroids, IVIG, anti-RhD immunoglobulin, TPO-RAs, rituximab, fostamatinib, and splenectomy in refractory cases. Monitoring for bleeding complications and treatment-related side effects is crucial.",
    "historicalBackground": "ITP was first described in the 18th century, but its autoimmune nature was not fully understood until the mid-20th century. Early treatments focused on splenectomy, while more recent advances have led to the development of immunomodulatory therapies and TPO-RAs.",
