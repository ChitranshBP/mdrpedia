    "description": "Carney complex (CNC) is a rare, autosomal dominant multiple neoplasia syndrome characterized by spotty skin pigmentation (lentigines, blue nevi, and café-au-lait spots), myxomas (cardiac, cutaneous, and mammary), endocrine tumors (primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease leading to Cushing syndrome, thyroid tumors, and testicular tumors), and schwannomas. Other manifestations can include large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors (LCCSCTs) of the testes, ductal adenomas of the breast, psammomatous melanotic schwannomas (PMS), and growth hormone-producing pituitary adenomas (acromegaly).",

    "eli5Summary": "Carney Complex is like having spots on your skin and sometimes getting bumps (tumors) in your heart, skin, or other places. Doctors need to check you regularly to make sure the bumps don't cause problems.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Carney complex (CNC) is a multiple neoplasia syndrome caused primarily by mutations in the PRKAR1A gene. It is characterized by a constellation of tumors and other features, including cardiac and cutaneous myxomas, spotty skin pigmentation, endocrine tumors (PPNAD, thyroid tumors, testicular tumors, pituitary adenomas), and schwannomas. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and careful clinical and genetic evaluation. Management involves surgical resection of tumors, medical management of endocrine abnormalities, and lifelong surveillance for tumor recurrence. Genetic counseling is essential for affected individuals and their families.",
    "historicalBackground": "Carney complex was first described by J. Aidan Carney in 1985, who recognized the association of cardiac myxomas, skin pigmentation, and endocrine overactivity. The genetic basis of the disease was later identified as mutations in the PRKAR1A gene.",
