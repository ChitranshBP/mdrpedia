    "description": "De Barsy syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by cutis laxa (loose, wrinkled skin), growth retardation, intellectual disability, progeroid features (premature aging), and distinctive facial features. The severity of symptoms can vary among affected individuals. Several subtypes exist, each linked to different gene mutations.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your skin is like a loose, wrinkly shirt that's too big. Kids with De Barsy Syndrome have skin like that, and they might grow slower and have a harder time learning. It's like their bodies are aging a little faster than they should.",
    "clinicalSummary": "De Barsy syndrome encompasses a group of rare, autosomal recessive disorders characterized by cutis laxa, growth retardation, intellectual disability, and progeroid features. The underlying pathology involves mutations in genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress response and protein glycosylation, leading to abnormal collagen and elastin synthesis. Clinical presentation includes generalized cutis laxa, particularly evident on the face and extremities, skeletal abnormalities, cataracts, and neurodevelopmental delays. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, skin biopsy, and genetic testing. Management is primarily supportive, addressing specific complications such as respiratory issues, feeding difficulties, and visual impairment. Prognosis is variable, with some individuals experiencing significant morbidity and mortality in early childhood.",
    "historicalBackground": "De Barsy syndrome was first described by De Barsy et al. in 1968. Initial reports focused on the clinical features of cutis laxa, growth retardation, and progeroid appearance. Subsequent research has identified various genetic mutations associated with the syndrome, leading to a better understanding of its molecular basis and heterogeneity.",
