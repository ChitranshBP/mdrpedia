    "description": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder and the most common known single-gene cause of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. It is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome, which leads to reduced or absent production of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is essential for normal brain development and function, particularly at synapses.",

    "eli5Summary": "Fragile X syndrome is like having a glitch in your brain's instruction manual. It makes learning and talking harder, and sometimes makes people act differently. It's caused by a tiny mistake in their DNA.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene located on the X chromosome (Xq27.3). This expansion leads to methylation and transcriptional silencing of the gene, resulting in a deficiency or absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, and regulation of mRNA translation. The clinical presentation of FXS is variable, with males generally more severely affected than females due to having only one X chromosome. Common features include intellectual disability, developmental delays, behavioral problems (ADHD, autism spectrum disorder), anxiety, and characteristic physical features. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing to detect the FMR1 mutation. Management focuses on multidisciplinary interventions, including educational support, behavioral therapies, and medications to address specific symptoms.",
    "historicalBackground": "Fragile X syndrome was first described by Martin and Bell in 1943. The cytogenetic abnormality (fragile site on the X chromosome) was discovered by Herbert Lubs in 1969. The FMR1 gene was identified and cloned in 1991, leading to the development of DNA-based diagnostic testing.",
