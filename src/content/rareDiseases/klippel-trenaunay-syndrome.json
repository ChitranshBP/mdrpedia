    "description": "Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital vascular disorder characterized by the triad of port-wine stain (capillary malformation), varicose veins, and bony and soft tissue hypertrophy, typically affecting one or more limbs. The severity of symptoms varies widely among affected individuals. While the exact cause is unknown, it is thought to be due to sporadic genetic mutations occurring during embryonic development.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine some of your blood vessels and bones grew a little differently before you were born. This can cause a birthmark (like a wine stain), some bigger veins, and maybe one of your arms or legs is a bit bigger than the other. Doctors can help manage these things to make you feel better.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the classic triad of capillary malformations (port-wine stains), venous varicosities, and limb hypertrophy. Lymphatic malformations are also frequently observed. The etiology is believed to involve sporadic mutations affecting vascular development. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by imaging studies such as Doppler ultrasound, MRI, and venography. Management is largely symptomatic and may include compression therapy, sclerotherapy, laser therapy, surgical interventions, and pain management. Complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and cellulitis require prompt treatment. Sirolimus is being investigated as a potential therapeutic agent. Genetic counseling is important to differentiate KTS from other related syndromes.",
    "historicalBackground": "Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome was first described in 1900 by French physicians Maurice Klippel and Paul Trénaunay.",
