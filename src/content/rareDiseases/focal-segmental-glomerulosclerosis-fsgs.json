    "description": "Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a pathological lesion of the kidney characterized by sclerosis (scarring) of some glomeruli and in only segments of each glomerulus. It is a relatively common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and adults, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease. FSGS can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to other conditions such as infections, drugs, or genetic mutations.",

    "clinicalSummary": "Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a clinicopathological entity characterized by the presence of sclerosis in some, but not all (focal), glomeruli and in segments of the affected glomeruli (segmental). FSGS is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome and can progress to end-stage renal disease. Primary FSGS is thought to be caused by a circulating permeability factor, while secondary FSGS is associated with identifiable causes such as infections, drugs, or genetic mutations. Diagnosis requires a kidney biopsy. Treatment focuses on reducing proteinuria and slowing disease progression with immunosuppressants, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, and supportive care. Prognosis varies, with some patients responding to treatment and others progressing to renal failure.",
    "historicalBackground": "FSGS was first described as a distinct entity in the mid-20th century. Over time, understanding of its various causes and subtypes has evolved, leading to more targeted treatment approaches. Research continues to focus on identifying the underlying mechanisms and developing more effective therapies.",
