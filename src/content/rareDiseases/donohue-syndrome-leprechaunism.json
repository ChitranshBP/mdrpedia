    "description": "Donohue syndrome, also known as leprechaunism, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme insulin resistance, growth retardation, and distinctive facial features. It is caused by mutations in the INSR gene, which provides instructions for making the insulin receptor. This receptor is essential for insulin to regulate glucose levels in the body. Affected individuals typically have severe feeding difficulties, developmental delays, and a shortened lifespan.",

    "clinicalSummary": "Donohue syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the INSR gene, leading to severe insulin resistance. The pathophysiology involves impaired insulin receptor function, causing hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. Clinically, patients present with intrauterine growth retardation, failure to thrive, characteristic facial features (e.g., prominent eyes, thick lips, low-set ears), acanthosis nigricans, and endocrine abnormalities. Diagnosis is confirmed through genetic testing. Management focuses on supportive care, including nutritional support and attempts to improve insulin sensitivity with medications like recombinant human insulin or IGF-1. Prognosis is generally poor, with most patients succumbing to complications in infancy or early childhood.",
    "historicalBackground": "Donohue syndrome was first described by Dr. William L. Donohue in 1948, who reported a case of a patient with severe insulin resistance and unusual physical features. The genetic basis of the disease, involving mutations in the INSR gene, was later elucidated.",
