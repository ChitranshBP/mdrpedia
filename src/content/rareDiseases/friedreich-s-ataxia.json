    "description": "Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system, resulting in symptoms ranging from muscle weakness and speech problems to heart disease. It is primarily caused by a deficiency of the protein frataxin, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and iron accumulation in cells, particularly in the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and cerebellum. The condition typically manifests in childhood or adolescence and leads to increasing disability over time.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body's wires are getting tangled, making it hard to walk, talk, and even keep your heart strong. That's kind of like Friedreich's Ataxia. It's a rare disease that makes it difficult for your body to control movement and can cause heart problems. Doctors are working hard to find better ways to help people with this condition.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder primarily caused by GAA repeat expansions within the first intron of the FXN gene, leading to reduced frataxin expression. Frataxin deficiency impairs mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, iron accumulation, and oxidative stress. Clinically, FRDA presents with progressive limb and gait ataxia, dysarthria, muscle weakness, sensory neuropathy, and areflexia. Cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing. Management focuses on symptomatic relief, including physical and occupational therapy, cardiac monitoring and treatment, and scoliosis management. Omaveloxolone is the first FDA-approved medication to treat FRDA. Research is ongoing to develop more effective therapies, including gene therapy and frataxin-enhancing compounds.",
    "historicalBackground": "Friedreich's ataxia was first described in the 1860s by Nikolaus Friedreich, a German pathologist and neurologist. He characterized the clinical features of the disease in a series of patients, establishing it as a distinct neurological entity. The genetic basis of FRDA was discovered in 1996, with the identification of the FXN gene and the GAA repeat expansion mutation.",
