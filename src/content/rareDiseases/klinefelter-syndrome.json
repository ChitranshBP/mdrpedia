    "description": "Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that results when a male is born with an extra copy of the X chromosome. Instead of the typical XY chromosome configuration, individuals with Klinefelter syndrome have an XXY configuration, or, less commonly, XXXY, XXXXY, or XXYY variants. This extra chromosome affects sexual development and can cause a range of physical and developmental challenges.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine boys usually have an X and a Y chromosome, like building blocks that make them boys. Klinefelter syndrome is when a boy has an extra X chromosome, so he has XXY instead of XY. This can make it harder for his body to make enough testosterone, which helps boys grow and develop. It can also make it harder to have kids when they grow up. Doctors can help with medicine and therapy to make things better.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) is a common sex chromosome aneuploidy in males, characterized by the presence of one or more extra X chromosomes. The most common karyotype is 47,XXY, but variants such as 48,XXYY, 48,XXXY, and 49,XXXXY also occur. The syndrome results from nondisjunction during meiosis in either the mother or father. Clinical features include small, firm testes (testicular dysgenesis), azoospermia and infertility, gynecomastia, and variable degrees of androgen deficiency. Affected individuals often present with tall stature, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. Diagnosis is confirmed by karyotype analysis. Management includes testosterone replacement therapy to address androgen deficiency, fertility treatment (if desired), and supportive therapies such as speech therapy, physical therapy, and psychological counseling. Increased risks of certain medical conditions, such as osteoporosis, autoimmune disorders, and certain cancers, necessitate ongoing monitoring.",
    "historicalBackground": "Klinefelter syndrome was first described in 1942 by Dr. Harry Klinefelter and his colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital. They observed a group of men with similar symptoms, including gynecomastia, small testes, and infertility. In 1959, Patricia Jacobs and J.A. Strong discovered that these men had an extra X chromosome, establishing the genetic basis of the syndrome.",
