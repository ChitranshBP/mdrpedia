    "description": "Hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles of the brain. This excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain, which can lead to a variety of neurological symptoms and developmental problems if left untreated. It can be congenital or acquired.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your brain is like a house with water pipes. Hydrocephalus is like having too much water in those pipes, making the house (your brain) swell and not work properly. Doctors can put in a special tube to drain the extra water or make a new escape route for it.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Hydrocephalus results from an imbalance between CSF production and absorption, leading to ventricular enlargement and increased intracranial pressure. This can be caused by obstruction of CSF flow (obstructive hydrocephalus) or impaired CSF absorption (communicating hydrocephalus). Congenital causes include neural tube defects and genetic syndromes, while acquired causes include infections, hemorrhage, and tumors. Clinical presentation varies with age and severity, ranging from macrocephaly and developmental delay in infants to headache, gait disturbances, and cognitive impairment in adults. Diagnosis involves neuroimaging to visualize ventricular size and identify underlying causes. Treatment primarily involves surgical intervention to divert CSF flow, either through shunt placement or ETV. Long-term management focuses on monitoring for shunt malfunction and addressing neurological sequelae.",
    "historicalBackground": "Hydrocephalus has been recognized since ancient times, with descriptions found in the writings of Hippocrates and Galen. Early treatments were largely ineffective, and the condition was often fatal. The development of shunt surgery in the 20th century revolutionized the management of hydrocephalus, significantly improving outcomes and quality of life for affected individuals.",
