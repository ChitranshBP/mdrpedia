    "description": "Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders affecting neuromuscular transmission. They are characterized by muscle weakness and fatigability, typically presenting in infancy or early childhood, although later onset is possible. CMS arises from genetic defects affecting various components of the neuromuscular junction, leading to impaired signal transmission between nerve and muscle.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your muscles need a message to move, like a text message. In CMS, the message doesn't get through properly, so your muscles get tired easily. It's like having a weak signal for your muscles.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) encompass a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by impaired neuromuscular transmission. Pathogenic variants in genes encoding proteins involved in presynaptic, synaptic, or postsynaptic function at the neuromuscular junction lead to variable clinical phenotypes. Electrophysiological studies, particularly repetitive nerve stimulation and single-fiber EMG, are crucial for diagnosis, demonstrating decremental responses. Genetic testing is essential for identifying the specific underlying mutation, guiding treatment strategies, and providing accurate genetic counseling. Management focuses on symptomatic relief using cholinesterase inhibitors, 3,4-DAP, or other medications, along with supportive care to address respiratory and feeding difficulties. The long-term prognosis varies depending on the specific genetic defect and the effectiveness of treatment.",
    "historicalBackground": "The first descriptions of congenital myasthenic syndromes date back to the early 20th century, but the genetic basis of these disorders has only been elucidated in recent decades. Advancements in molecular genetics have led to the identification of numerous genes associated with CMS, improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling more targeted therapeutic approaches.",
