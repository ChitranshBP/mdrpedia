    "description": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness due to alterations in the dystrophin protein. Primarily affecting males, DMD typically manifests in early childhood, leading to loss of ambulation, respiratory and cardiac complications, and reduced life expectancy. Management focuses on supportive care, including physical therapy, respiratory support, and pharmacological interventions to slow disease progression and improve quality of life.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your muscles are like building blocks, and in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, some of those blocks are missing. This makes it hard to run, jump, and even breathe as you get older. Doctors try to help by giving medicine and exercises to keep your muscles as strong as possible.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin, a protein essential for muscle fiber integrity. The absence or dysfunction of dystrophin leads to progressive muscle fiber damage, inflammation, and eventual replacement of muscle tissue with fat and connective tissue. Clinically, DMD presents with proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase levels, and characteristic features such as Gower's sign. Cardiac and respiratory complications are common and contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis is confirmed through genetic testing and muscle biopsy. Management includes corticosteroids, exon-skipping therapies, gene therapy, and supportive care to optimize function and prolong survival.",
    "historicalBackground": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy was first described in detail by the French neurologist Guillaume Benjamin Amand Duchenne in the mid-19th century. The genetic basis of the disease was discovered in 1986, with the identification of the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome.",
