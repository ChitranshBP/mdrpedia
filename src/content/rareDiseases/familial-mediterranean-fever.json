    "description": "Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an inherited autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent, short episodes of fever accompanied by inflammation of the abdomen, chest, or joints. It primarily affects people of Mediterranean ancestry, including Sephardic Jews, Turks, Armenians, and Arabs. The condition is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene, which leads to dysregulation of the inflammatory response. Untreated FMF can lead to amyloidosis, a serious complication affecting the kidneys.",

    "clinicalSummary": "Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease caused by mutations in the MEFV gene, located on chromosome 16. The MEFV gene encodes pyrin, a protein involved in regulating inflammation. Mutations in MEFV lead to uncontrolled activation of the inflammasome and excessive production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), resulting in recurrent episodes of fever and serositis. Clinical diagnosis is based on the Tel Hashomer criteria, which include major criteria (recurrent fever, abdominal pain, chest pain, arthritis) and minor criteria (erysipelas-like rash, family history). Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis by identifying MEFV mutations. Complications include AA amyloidosis, primarily affecting the kidneys, leading to proteinuria and renal failure. Treatment with colchicine is highly effective in preventing attacks and amyloidosis. IL-1 inhibitors are used in colchicine-resistant cases.",
    "historicalBackground": "FMF was first described in the early 20th century, with significant advancements in understanding its genetic basis and pathophysiology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The discovery of the MEFV gene in 1997 was a major breakthrough.",
