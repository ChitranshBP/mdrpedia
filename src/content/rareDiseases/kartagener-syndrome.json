    "description": "Kartagener syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the triad of situs inversus (reversal of the internal organs), chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. It is a subtype of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition affecting the function of cilia, which are microscopic hair-like structures that line the airways, sinuses, and other organs. The impaired ciliary function leads to mucus buildup and recurrent respiratory infections.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine tiny hairs in your body that help clean your lungs and nose. In Kartagener syndrome, these hairs don't work right, so you get lots of colds and sinus infections. Also, your organs might be flipped around inside your body!",
    "clinicalSummary": "Kartagener syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by defects in ciliary structure and function, leading to impaired mucociliary clearance. The classic triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis results from the failure of cilia to properly establish left-right asymmetry during embryogenesis and ineffective clearance of mucus from the airways. Diagnosis involves assessing ciliary beat frequency and pattern, electron microscopy, and genetic testing. Management focuses on airway clearance, infection control, and supportive care. Fertility issues are common in males due to sperm immotility. Lung transplantation may be considered in severe cases of bronchiectasis.",
    "historicalBackground": "Kartagener syndrome was first described in 1933 by Manes Kartagener, a Swiss physician, who noted the association between situs inversus, sinusitis, and bronchiectasis.",
