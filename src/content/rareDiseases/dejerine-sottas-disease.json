    "description": "Dejerine-Sottas disease (DSD) is a rare, inherited neurological disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and sensory loss, typically beginning in infancy or early childhood. It is a severe form of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN), also known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. DSD results from demyelination and axonal degeneration of peripheral nerves, leading to impaired motor and sensory function.",

    "eli5Summary": "Dejerine-Sottas disease is a rare condition where your muscles get weak and you have trouble feeling things, starting when you're a baby. It's like your body's wires (nerves) aren't working right, making it hard to move and feel.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Dejerine-Sottas disease (DSD) is a severe form of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by early-onset, progressive demyelination and axonal degeneration of peripheral nerves. Clinical features include profound hypotonia, delayed motor development, areflexia, sensory impairment, and often palpable enlargement of peripheral nerves. Genetic mutations in genes such as PMP22, MPZ, EGR2, PRX, and MTMR2 are implicated. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, electrophysiological studies demonstrating severely reduced nerve conduction velocities, nerve biopsy showing onion bulb formations, and genetic testing to identify causative mutations. Management is primarily supportive, focusing on physical and occupational therapy, orthotics, and pain management. Respiratory complications may necessitate ventilatory support. The prognosis is variable, with some individuals experiencing significant disability and shortened lifespan, while others have a milder course.",
    "historicalBackground": "Dejerine-Sottas disease was first described by Joseph Dejerine and Jules Sottas in 1893. They reported on two siblings with progressive motor and sensory neuropathy, characterized by thickened peripheral nerves and early onset.",
