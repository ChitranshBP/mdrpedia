    "description": "Distal spinal muscular atrophy (dSMA) comprises a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) primarily affecting the distal muscles of the limbs (hands and feet). Different forms of dSMA exist, each with varying genetic causes, age of onset, and severity. The condition is caused by the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, which control voluntary muscle movement.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your muscles are like tiny workers that help you move. In dSMA, the workers in your hands and feet get tired and weak, making it hard to do things like write or walk. Doctors try to help by giving you special exercises and tools to make things easier.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Distal spinal muscular atrophy (dSMA) represents a heterogeneous group of motor neuron disorders characterized by progressive distal limb weakness and atrophy. Pathologically, dSMA involves the degeneration of lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Genetic causes vary, with mutations in genes such as HSPB1, GARS1, and DYNC1H1 identified in different subtypes. Clinical presentation includes distal muscle weakness, atrophy, and often sensory changes. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, EMG, nerve conduction studies, and genetic testing. Management is primarily supportive, focusing on physical and occupational therapy, orthotics, and respiratory support as needed. Research is ongoing to explore potential gene therapies and other targeted treatments.",
    "historicalBackground": "Distal spinal muscular atrophies have been recognized as distinct entities within the broader spectrum of motor neuron diseases for several decades. Initial descriptions focused on clinical phenotypes, with subsequent advances in genetics leading to the identification of specific gene mutations responsible for different subtypes.",
