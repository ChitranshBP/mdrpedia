    "description": "Alagille syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects multiple organ systems in the body, including the liver, heart, kidneys, and eyes. The most prominent feature of Alagille syndrome is liver damage caused by abnormalities in the bile ducts. Bile, a fluid produced by the liver, aids in digestion. In individuals with Alagille syndrome, the bile ducts may be narrowed, malformed, or reduced in number, leading to bile buildup in the liver (cholestasis) and subsequent liver damage. Other common features include heart defects, butterfly vertebrae, characteristic facial features, and kidney abnormalities.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your liver has tiny tubes that help it clean your body. In Alagille syndrome, these tubes are messed up, so the liver can't clean properly. This can cause yellow skin, itchy skin, and other problems with your heart, eyes, and bones. Doctors can help with medicine and sometimes surgery to make you feel better.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is a multisystemic disorder primarily affecting the liver, heart, eyes, skeleton, and kidneys. It is caused by mutations in the JAG1 gene (most common) or NOTCH2 gene, which encode ligands involved in the Notch signaling pathway, crucial for cell fate determination during development. The hallmark hepatic feature is paucity of interlobular bile ducts, leading to cholestasis and progressive liver damage. Cardiac manifestations commonly include peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. Ocular findings include posterior embryotoxon. Skeletal abnormalities, such as butterfly vertebrae, are also characteristic. Renal involvement can range from mild abnormalities to renal tubular acidosis. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, liver biopsy, and genetic testing. Management focuses on symptomatic relief of pruritus, nutritional support, and treatment of complications. Liver transplantation is considered for patients with severe liver disease. The prognosis is variable, with some patients experiencing mild disease and others requiring liver transplantation or succumbing to complications in infancy or childhood.",
    "historicalBackground": "Alagille syndrome was first described by Daniel Alagille in 1969, who characterized the association of cholestasis, heart disease, and skeletal abnormalities in affected individuals. The genetic basis of the disease was later identified in the 1990s with the discovery of mutations in the JAG1 gene.",
