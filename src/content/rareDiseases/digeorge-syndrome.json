    "description": "DiGeorge syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a deletion on chromosome 22, specifically at the 22q11.2 locus. This deletion leads to the maldevelopment of several body systems, including the heart, parathyroid glands, thymus gland, and facial features. The severity of symptoms varies widely among affected individuals.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body is like a car, and sometimes a tiny piece of the instruction manual (chromosome 22) is missing. This can cause problems with the heart, immune system, and other parts, making it harder for the car to run smoothly. Doctors can help by giving medicine, doing surgery, and providing extra support to make the car work as best as it can.",
    "clinicalSummary": "DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome) is a complex multisystem disorder resulting from a microdeletion on the long arm of chromosome 22. The deletion encompasses approximately 30-40 genes, with TBX1 being a key gene involved in the pathogenesis of many features. The syndrome is characterized by variable expressivity, leading to a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Cardiac anomalies, particularly conotruncal defects, are common. Thymic hypoplasia or aplasia results in T-cell lymphopenia and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Hypoparathyroidism leads to hypocalcemia, which can cause seizures and other neurological symptoms. Craniofacial features include cleft palate, micrognathia, and hypertelorism. Neurodevelopmental delays and psychiatric disorders are frequently observed. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by FISH or CMA. Management involves addressing specific organ system involvement, including cardiac surgery, calcium supplementation, and immune support. Long-term follow-up is essential to monitor for complications and provide appropriate interventions.",
    "historicalBackground": "DiGeorge syndrome was first described by Angelo DiGeorge in 1965, who noted the association between thymic aplasia and parathyroid abnormalities. The genetic basis of the syndrome, specifically the 22q11.2 deletion, was identified in the early 1990s.",
