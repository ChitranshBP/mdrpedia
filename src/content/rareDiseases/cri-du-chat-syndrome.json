    "description": "Cri-du-Chat syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deletion of genetic material on the short arm (p arm) of chromosome 5. The syndrome is characterized by a distinctive, high-pitched, cat-like cry in infancy, intellectual disability, delayed development, distinctive facial features, and small head size (microcephaly).",

    "eli5Summary": "Cri-du-Chat is when a tiny piece of a baby's body plan is missing. It makes them cry like a cat, and they might need extra help learning and growing.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Cri-du-Chat syndrome results from a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p-). The size of the deletion varies, influencing the severity of the phenotype. Common clinical features include a distinctive cat-like cry due to laryngeal abnormalities, intellectual disability, developmental delay, microcephaly, facial dysmorphisms (hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, broad nasal bridge, micrognathia), and congenital heart defects. Diagnosis is typically made through karyotype analysis or chromosomal microarray. Management involves multidisciplinary supportive care, including early intervention programs, physical, occupational, and speech therapy, and treatment of associated medical conditions.",
    "historicalBackground": "Cri-du-Chat syndrome was first described by Jérôme Lejeune in 1963, who identified the chromosomal deletion responsible for the condition.",
