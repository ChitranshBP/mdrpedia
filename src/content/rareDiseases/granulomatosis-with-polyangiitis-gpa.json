    "description": "Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) in the nose, sinuses, ears, lungs, and kidneys. It is often associated with the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in the blood. GPA can cause a range of symptoms and, if left untreated, can lead to organ damage and even death.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body's defense system is attacking your blood vessels, especially in your nose, lungs, and kidneys. This causes swelling and damage, making it hard for those organs to work right. Doctors use strong medicines to calm down your defense system and stop it from attacking.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis affecting small to medium-sized vessels. The disease classically involves the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the kidneys, but can affect virtually any organ system. The pathogenesis involves ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation and endothelial damage. Diagnosis requires a combination of clinical findings, laboratory data (including ANCA testing), and histopathological evidence from biopsy. Treatment typically involves induction therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclophosphamide or rituximab) followed by maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.",
    "historicalBackground": "GPA was first described by Friedrich Wegener in 1936. It was originally known as Wegener's Granulomatosis. Due to Wegener's association with Nazi activities, there has been a movement to rename the disease to Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA).",
