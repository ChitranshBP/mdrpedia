    "description": "Angelman syndrome is a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. It is characterized by severe intellectual disability, delayed development, problems with movement and balance (ataxia), seizures, and a generally happy demeanor with frequent smiling and laughter. Individuals with Angelman syndrome typically have a small head size (microcephaly) and fair skin with light-colored hair.",

    "eli5Summary": "Angelman Syndrome is a genetic condition that makes kids have trouble with talking, walking, and learning. They often smile and laugh a lot and seem very happy, but they need extra help to grow and develop.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of function of the maternally inherited UBE3A gene located on chromosome 15q11.2-q13. The most common mechanism is a deletion of the maternal 15q11.2-q13 region. Other mechanisms include paternal uniparental disomy, imprinting defects, and mutations in the UBE3A gene itself. Clinically, AS is characterized by severe developmental delay or intellectual disability, speech impairment (often nonverbal), movement or balance disorder, usually ataxia of gait and/or tremulous movement of limbs, and a behavioral phenotype of frequent laughter/smiling, apparent happiness, and excitability. Seizures are common. Diagnosis is confirmed through genetic testing, including methylation analysis and UBE3A sequencing. Management focuses on symptomatic treatment, including seizure control, physical and occupational therapy, speech therapy, and behavioral interventions.",
    "historicalBackground": "Angelman syndrome was first described by Dr. Harry Angelman in 1965, who observed three children with similar characteristics. He initially referred to the condition as 'Happy Puppet Syndrome' due to their jerky movements and frequent smiling. The genetic basis of the syndrome was later discovered in the late 1980s and early 1990s.",
