    "description": "Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a rare, lifelong disorder affecting the autonomic nervous system, primarily impacting respiratory control. Individuals with CCHS have a reduced or absent ventilatory response to hypercapnia (increased carbon dioxide) and hypoxemia (decreased oxygen) and may require lifelong ventilatory support, especially during sleep. The condition is often associated with mutations in the PHOX2B gene.",

    "clinicalSummary": "Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a rare disorder characterized by a failure of autonomic control of respiration, leading to alveolar hypoventilation. The primary defect lies in the brainstem's chemoreceptors, resulting in an impaired response to hypercapnia and hypoxemia. The majority of cases are linked to heterozygous mutations in the PHOX2B gene, a transcription factor crucial for the development of the autonomic nervous system. Clinical presentation typically occurs in the neonatal period with unexplained hypoventilation, often requiring mechanical ventilation. Associated features may include Hirschsprung's disease, neural crest tumors, and other autonomic dysfunctions. Diagnosis involves polysomnography, arterial blood gas analysis, and genetic testing. Management focuses on providing adequate ventilatory support, either through tracheostomy with mechanical ventilation or diaphragm pacing. Long-term monitoring for complications and associated conditions is essential.",
    "historicalBackground": "CCHS was first described in the medical literature in the 1970s. The association with PHOX2B mutations was discovered in 2003, marking a significant advancement in understanding the genetic basis of the disease.",
