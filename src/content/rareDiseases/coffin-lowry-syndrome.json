    "description": "Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and growth retardation. It primarily affects males, with females typically exhibiting milder symptoms. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene, which plays a crucial role in cell signaling and brain development.",

    "eli5Summary": "Coffin-Lowry Syndrome is a rare problem that makes it hard for your brain to learn and your body to grow normally. It changes how your face looks and can make your bones a little different. Doctors and therapists can help you learn and be as healthy as possible.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) is an X-linked dominant disorder caused by mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene, encoding ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2). This kinase is involved in signal transduction pathways regulating cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, particularly within the brain. Clinically, CLS presents with moderate to severe intellectual disability, characteristic facial dysmorphisms (including a prominent forehead, hypertelorism, thick everted lips, and a broad nasal bridge), skeletal abnormalities (such as kyphoscoliosis and pectus excavatum), and growth retardation. Affected individuals may also exhibit hypotonia, tapered fingers with short, broad thumbs, and behavioral problems. Diagnosis is confirmed through genetic testing. Management is primarily supportive, focusing on educational, behavioral, and physical therapies to optimize developmental outcomes and address associated medical complications.",
    "historicalBackground": "Coffin-Lowry syndrome was first described independently by Dr. Grange S. Coffin in 1966 and Dr. Robert Lowry in 1971. The genetic basis of the syndrome was identified in 1996 with the discovery of mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene.",
