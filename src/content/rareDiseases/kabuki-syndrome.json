    "eli5Summary": "Kabuki syndrome is a rare condition that makes kids look a little different, learn at a slower pace, and sometimes have problems with their heart, kidneys, or immune system. Doctors can help them with these problems so they can live happy lives.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Kabuki syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, postnatal growth deficiency, and various systemic anomalies. It is primarily caused by mutations in the KMT2D (lysine methyltransferase 2D) gene on chromosome 12q13.12 or the KDM6A (lysine demethylase 6A) gene on chromosome Xp11.3. These genes are involved in histone methylation, a crucial epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression during development. Clinical manifestations are highly variable, even within families, and can include cardiac, renal, skeletal, and immunological abnormalities. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical findings and confirmed by genetic testing. Management is multidisciplinary, focusing on addressing specific symptoms and complications.",
    "historicalBackground": "Kabuki syndrome was first described independently by two Japanese researchers, Dr. Yoshikazu Niikawa and Dr. Norio Kuroki, in 1981. The name \"Kabuki\" refers to the traditional Japanese theater, as the facial features of affected individuals were thought to resemble the makeup of Kabuki actors.",
