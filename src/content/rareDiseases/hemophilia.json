    "description": "Hemophilia is a rare, inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot normally. This is due to a deficiency or absence of certain clotting factors, proteins needed for blood to clot. The two main types are hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency).",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your blood is like glue that helps stop cuts from bleeding. Hemophilia is when your blood doesn't have enough of the special ingredients to make that glue, so you might bleed longer than usual if you get hurt.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency in coagulation factors, most commonly factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B). The severity of hemophilia varies depending on the level of clotting factor activity. Severe hemophilia is defined as <1% factor activity, moderate hemophilia as 1-5% factor activity, and mild hemophilia as 5-40% factor activity. Clinical manifestations include spontaneous or prolonged bleeding into joints, muscles, and other tissues. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring factor VIII or IX levels and genetic testing. Treatment involves replacement therapy with recombinant or plasma-derived clotting factors, emicizumab for hemophilia A, and gene therapy for certain subtypes. Complications include joint damage, inhibitor development, and transfusion-related infections (rare with modern recombinant products).",
    "historicalBackground": "Hemophilia has been recognized for centuries, with descriptions dating back to ancient times. It was historically known as 'the royal disease' due to its prevalence among European royal families, particularly descendants of Queen Victoria, who was a carrier of the hemophilia B gene.",
