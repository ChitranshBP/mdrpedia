    "description": "Aspergillosis is an infection caused by Aspergillus, a common mold that lives indoors and outdoors. Most people breathe in Aspergillus spores every day without getting sick. However, people with weakened immune systems or lung diseases are at a higher risk of developing health problems due to Aspergillus. The types of health problems caused by Aspergillus include allergic reactions, lung infections, and infections in other organs.",

    "eli5Summary": "Aspergillosis is like getting sick from a mold called Aspergillus. This mold is everywhere, but it usually only makes people with weak immune systems or lung problems sick. It can cause coughing, fever, and trouble breathing, but doctors can give you medicine to help you get better.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Aspergillosis encompasses a spectrum of diseases caused by fungi of the genus Aspergillus, most commonly Aspergillus fumigatus. Clinical manifestations range from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) to invasive aspergillosis (IA). ABPA is characterized by an allergic response to Aspergillus antigens in the airways, leading to asthma-like symptoms and bronchiectasis. CPA includes aspergilloma (a fungal ball in a pre-existing lung cavity) and chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA), a progressive destructive lung infection. IA is a life-threatening infection that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, such as those with neutropenia, hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, and solid organ transplant recipients. Diagnosis involves imaging studies, mycological testing (culture, galactomannan assay), and histopathology. Treatment depends on the type of aspergillosis and includes antifungal medications (azoles, amphotericin B), corticosteroids (for ABPA), and surgical resection (for aspergilloma).",
    "historicalBackground": "Aspergillosis was first described in the 19th century. The association between Aspergillus and lung disease was recognized early on, and the understanding of the different forms of aspergillosis has evolved over time with advances in medical mycology and immunology.",
