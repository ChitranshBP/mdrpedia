    "description": "Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is a rare, acquired muscle disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, predominantly affecting the muscles of the thighs, forearms, and fingers. It is the most common acquired muscle disease in people over the age of 50. The condition progresses slowly over years, leading to significant disability.",

    "eli5Summary": "Inclusion Body Myositis is a rare disease that makes your muscles weak, especially in your legs, arms, and fingers. It happens mostly to older people and gets worse slowly over time. Doctors can help you stay strong with exercises and sometimes medicines, but there is no cure.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is a chronic, progressive myopathy characterized by muscle weakness, particularly affecting the quadriceps, distal upper extremity muscles (finger flexors), and pharyngeal muscles. Histopathological hallmarks include endomysial inflammation, rimmed vacuoles, and amyloid deposits containing TDP-43. The pathogenesis involves both autoimmune and degenerative mechanisms. Diagnosis requires muscle biopsy demonstrating characteristic features. Treatment is primarily supportive, focusing on physical and occupational therapy. Immunosuppressive therapies have limited efficacy. Disease progression leads to significant functional impairment and disability.",
    "historicalBackground": "Inclusion Body Myositis was first described as a distinct entity in the 1960s and 1970s, differentiating it from other inflammatory myopathies like polymyositis. The identification of rimmed vacuoles and amyloid deposits in muscle biopsies led to its recognition as a unique disease with a distinct pathophysiology.",
