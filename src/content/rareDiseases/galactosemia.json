    "description": "Galactosemia is a rare inherited metabolic disorder that affects an individual's ability to metabolize galactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products, as well as some fruits and vegetables. This occurs due to a deficiency in one of the enzymes needed to convert galactose into glucose, which the body uses for energy. The most common and severe form is classic galactosemia, caused by a deficiency in the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) enzyme. Early diagnosis and dietary management are crucial to prevent serious complications.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body has trouble using a type of sugar called galactose, which is in milk. Galactosemia is when your body can't break down galactose properly. If you have it, you need to avoid milk and some other foods to stay healthy.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Galactosemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by the body's inability to metabolize galactose due to enzyme deficiencies, most commonly galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT). This leads to the accumulation of galactose and its metabolites in the blood and tissues, causing liver damage, neurological impairment, cataracts, and other complications. Newborn screening is crucial for early detection. Management involves strict dietary restriction of galactose throughout life. Long-term complications, such as speech deficits, motor skill challenges, and ovarian dysfunction in females, may still occur despite dietary control. Regular monitoring and multidisciplinary care are essential.",
    "historicalBackground": "Galactosemia was first described in 1917 by Von Reuss. The enzymatic defect was identified by Leloir in the 1950s, leading to the development of newborn screening programs and dietary interventions that have dramatically improved the prognosis for affected individuals.",
