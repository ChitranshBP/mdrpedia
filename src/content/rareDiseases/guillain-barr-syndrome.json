    "description": "Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a rare autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the peripheral nerves. This leads to muscle weakness, loss of reflexes, and numbness or tingling in the limbs. In severe cases, it can cause paralysis and affect breathing, requiring intensive care. Most individuals recover fully, but some have permanent nerve damage.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body's police (immune system) get confused and start attacking your own nerves. This makes your muscles weak, like your legs feeling wobbly. Doctors can help by giving you special medicine to calm down the police or clean your blood to remove the attackers. Most people get better, but it takes time and help from therapists to get strong again.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an acute, immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy characterized by ascending symmetrical weakness, areflexia, and variable sensory findings. It is often preceded by a bacterial or viral infection, triggering an autoimmune response targeting peripheral nerve myelin or axons. Pathological hallmarks include demyelination, axonal degeneration, and inflammation of peripheral nerves and nerve roots. Clinical variants include AIDP, AMAN, AMSAN, and MFS. Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation, nerve conduction studies showing demyelination or axonal damage, and CSF analysis demonstrating albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein with normal cell count). Treatment involves IVIg or plasmapheresis to modulate the immune response, along with supportive care including mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, pain management, and rehabilitation. Prognosis is variable, with most patients experiencing significant recovery, but some may have persistent deficits or relapse.",
    "historicalBackground": "Guillain-Barré Syndrome was first described in 1916 by Georges Guillain, Jean Alexandre Barré, and André Strohl, who reported two soldiers with ascending paralysis and areflexia.",
