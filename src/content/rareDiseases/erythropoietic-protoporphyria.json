    "description": "Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal accumulation of protoporphyrin in erythrocytes (red blood cells), plasma, and sometimes the liver. This buildup leads to acute photosensitivity, causing painful, non-blistering skin reactions upon exposure to sunlight or certain artificial lights. In some cases, EPP can result in liver complications, including protoporphyric hepatopathy and liver failure.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your skin is super sensitive to sunlight. That's like having EPP. When you go in the sun, your skin gets really painful, red, and itchy, but it doesn't usually get blisters. It's because your body has too much of a certain substance called protoporphyrin. You need to be extra careful in the sun and wear protective clothing.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) results from a deficiency in ferrochelatase (FECH), the enzyme catalyzing the insertion of iron into protoporphyrin to form heme. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of protoporphyrin in erythrocytes, plasma, and liver. Patients typically present with acute photosensitivity characterized by pain, erythema, and edema upon sun exposure. Chronic exposure can lead to lichenification. A subset of patients develop protoporphyric hepatopathy, potentially progressing to liver failure. Diagnosis involves measuring protoporphyrin levels and genetic testing. Management includes sun protection, afamelanotide, and, in severe cases, liver transplantation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",
    "historicalBackground": "Erythropoietic protoporphyria was first described in the 1960s. The genetic basis of EPP, involving mutations in the FECH gene, was identified in the 1990s. The development of afamelanotide has significantly improved the quality of life for many individuals with EPP.",
