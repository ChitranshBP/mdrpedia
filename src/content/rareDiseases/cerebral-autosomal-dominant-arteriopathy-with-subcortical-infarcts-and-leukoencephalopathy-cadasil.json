    "description": "Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary stroke disorder caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. This condition primarily affects small blood vessels in the brain, leading to recurrent strokes, cognitive decline, migraine with aura, and psychiatric disturbances. The progressive accumulation of these infarcts and white matter lesions results in significant neurological impairment.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine tiny blood vessels in your brain getting sick. CADASIL is like that. It's passed down in families and makes it hard for your brain to get enough blood. This can cause headaches, trouble thinking, and sometimes even make it hard to move or talk.",
    "clinicalSummary": "CADASIL is a systemic arteriopathy caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, leading to the accumulation of NOTCH3 protein in the smooth muscle cells of small to medium-sized arteries. This accumulation results in thickening of the vessel walls, fibrosis, and ultimately, reduced blood flow to the brain. Clinically, CADASIL manifests with migraine with aura, recurrent ischemic strokes, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances. MRI findings include characteristic white matter hyperintensities, particularly in the anterior temporal lobes and external capsules, and lacunar infarcts. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing for NOTCH3 mutations. Management focuses on symptomatic treatment and vascular risk factor modification.",
    "historicalBackground": "CADASIL was first described in the late 20th century. The NOTCH3 gene was identified as the causative gene in 1996, marking a significant breakthrough in understanding the disease's pathogenesis.",
