    "description": "Hyper IgM syndrome is a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by a defect in the immune system, specifically affecting the ability of B cells to switch from producing IgM antibodies to other types of antibodies such as IgG, IgA, and IgE. This leads to elevated levels of IgM in the blood and a deficiency in other antibody types, making affected individuals highly susceptible to infections, particularly opportunistic infections.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body's army (immune system) can only make one type of weapon (IgM antibodies) and can't switch to making other important weapons (IgG, IgA). This makes it hard to fight off infections, so doctors give you extra weapons (antibodies) and medicine to help.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Hyper IgM syndrome (HIGM) encompasses a group of primary immunodeficiency disorders characterized by defective immunoglobulin class switching. The most common form is X-linked HIGM (HIGM1), caused by mutations in the CD40 ligand (CD40L) gene. Other forms include autosomal recessive HIGM due to mutations in genes such as AICDA, UNG, and CD40. Clinically, HIGM presents with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, opportunistic infections (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, Cryptosporidium parvum), and an increased risk of autoimmune complications. Diagnosis involves assessing serum immunoglobulin levels (elevated IgM, decreased IgG, IgA, and IgE), flow cytometry for CD40L expression, and genetic testing. Management includes immunoglobulin replacement therapy, prophylactic antibiotics, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for severe cases. Gene therapy is an emerging treatment option.",
    "historicalBackground": "The first description of Hyper IgM syndrome was in the 1960s. The genetic basis of the X-linked form (CD40L deficiency) was identified in the early 1990s, leading to a better understanding of the disease mechanism and improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",
