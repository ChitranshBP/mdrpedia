    "description": "Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the malformation of the brainstem and cerebellum, specifically the 'molar tooth sign' (MTS) visible on brain imaging. This malformation leads to a range of neurological and physical symptoms, varying in severity among affected individuals. JS is often associated with other organ system involvement, making it a ciliopathy.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your brain has a special part that helps you balance and move smoothly. In Joubert Syndrome, that part doesn't form correctly, like a funny-looking tooth on a scan. This can make it hard to walk, talk, and sometimes causes problems with your eyes, kidneys, or breathing. Doctors and therapists can help you learn and grow!",
    "clinicalSummary": "Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and a distinctive 'molar tooth sign' (MTS) on axial MRI, resulting from abnormal development of the midbrain and hindbrain. The MTS is pathognomonic, involving thickened superior cerebellar peduncles, a deep interpeduncular fossa, and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. Clinically, JS presents with hypotonia, ataxia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and abnormal eye movements. Respiratory abnormalities, such as episodic hyperpnea or apnea, are common in infancy. Multi-organ involvement, including renal disease (nephronophthisis), retinal dystrophy, and hepatic fibrosis, is frequently observed, classifying JS as a ciliopathy due to mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in cilia function. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and neuroimaging, confirmed by genetic testing. Management is supportive, focusing on symptom management and addressing associated complications. Prognosis varies depending on the severity of neurological and systemic involvement.",
    "historicalBackground": "Joubert syndrome was first described by Dr. Marie Joubert in 1969, who reported four affected siblings with cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and episodic hyperpnea. Subsequent research has elucidated the genetic basis and expanded the clinical spectrum of the disorder.",
