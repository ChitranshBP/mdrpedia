    "description": "Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) is a rare, inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by the triad of abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia. It results from defects in telomere maintenance, leading to premature cellular senescence and a predisposition to bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and cancer.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body's cells have tiny clocks called telomeres that get shorter each time they divide. Dyskeratosis Congenita is like having faulty clocks that run down too quickly. This causes problems with your skin, nails, mouth, and bone marrow, making it hard for your body to make new blood cells.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by defective telomere maintenance, leading to premature cellular senescence and a predisposition to bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and cancer. The classical triad of mucocutaneous features includes abnormal skin pigmentation (reticular pigmentation, especially on the neck and upper chest), nail dystrophy (thin, brittle, or absent nails), and oral leukoplakia (white patches in the mouth). Bone marrow failure is a common and life-threatening complication, often presenting as anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia. Pulmonary fibrosis is another significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Patients with DC have an increased risk of developing various cancers, particularly squamous cell carcinoma and myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings, telomere length measurement (flow FISH), and genetic testing to identify mutations in genes involved in telomere maintenance (e.g., TERT, TERC, DKC1, WRAP53, RTEL1). Treatment options include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), androgens, growth factors, immunosuppressive therapy, and supportive care. Management of pulmonary fibrosis and cancer is also crucial for improving outcomes.",
    "historicalBackground": "Dyskeratosis Congenita was first described in 1910 by Zinsser. Cole and Engman further characterized the syndrome in subsequent reports. The genetic basis of DC, involving telomere maintenance genes, was elucidated in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",
