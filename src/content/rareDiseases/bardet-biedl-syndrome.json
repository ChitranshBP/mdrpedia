    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body has tiny helpers that aren't working right. This can make it hard to see, cause you to gain weight easily, and sometimes you might have extra fingers or toes. It can also make learning a little tricky. Doctors can help with special glasses, healthy food, and extra help in school.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy resulting from mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the structure and function of cilia. Dysfunction of cilia leads to a pleiotropic phenotype affecting multiple organ systems. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and confirmed by genetic testing. Management involves addressing individual symptoms through a multidisciplinary approach, including ophthalmological, nephrological, endocrinological, and developmental interventions. Progressive renal disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.",
    "historicalBackground": "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome was first described independently by Georges Bardet in 1920 and Arthur Biedl in 1922. They both reported families with the characteristic features of obesity, polydactyly, retinal dystrophy, and mental retardation.",
