    "description": "Alexander disease is a rare and often fatal neurological disorder characterized by the progressive destruction of white matter in the brain (leukodystrophy). It is caused by mutations in the GFAP gene, which encodes glial fibrillary acidic protein, a major component of astrocytes. The disease primarily affects the brain and spinal cord, leading to a range of neurological symptoms.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your brain has special helpers called astrocytes that keep everything tidy. In Alexander disease, the instructions for making these helpers are messed up, so they make a sticky substance that clogs up the brain and makes it hard to think, move, and grow.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Alexander disease (AxD) is a progressive leukodystrophy resulting from heterozygous mutations in the GFAP gene, leading to the formation of Rosenthal fibers within astrocytes. These fibers disrupt normal astrocyte function, causing white matter destruction and neurological dysfunction. Clinical presentation varies with age of onset, with infantile AxD being the most severe, characterized by megalencephaly, seizures, and developmental delay. Juvenile and adult forms present with ataxia, bulbar symptoms, and spasticity. Diagnosis is confirmed by MRI findings of white matter abnormalities and genetic testing for GFAP mutations. Treatment is primarily supportive, focusing on symptom management. Gene therapy approaches are under investigation.",
    "historicalBackground": "Alexander disease was first described by W. Stewart Alexander in 1949, who identified characteristic pathological features in the brain of an affected infant.",
