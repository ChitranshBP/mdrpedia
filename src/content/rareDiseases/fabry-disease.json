    "description": "Fabry disease is a rare, inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). This deficiency leads to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in various cells throughout the body, leading to a wide range of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. The disease is X-linked, affecting both males and females, though females often have milder symptoms.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body has tiny workers that clean up a certain type of sugar. In Fabry disease, these workers are broken, so the sugar builds up and causes problems in your heart, kidneys, and other parts of your body. Doctors can give you medicine to help clean up the sugar or fix the broken workers.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder resulting from a deficiency in the enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), encoded by the GLA gene. This enzymatic deficiency leads to the progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and related glycosphingolipids within lysosomes of various cell types, including endothelial, epithelial, neuronal, and cardiac cells. The clinical manifestations are highly variable, ranging from mild to severe, and can include angiokeratomas, acroparesthesias, corneal and lenticular opacities, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular events, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Diagnosis involves enzyme assays and genetic testing. Treatment options include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant α-Gal A and chaperone therapy with migalastat, a pharmacological chaperone that enhances the stability of certain mutant forms of α-Gal A. Supportive care addresses specific organ involvement and pain management. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent or delay the progression of organ damage and improve patient outcomes.",
    "historicalBackground": "Fabry disease was first described independently by Johannes Fabry and William Anderson in 1898. Fabry described a 13-year-old boy with angiokeratomas, while Anderson described a 39-year-old man with similar skin lesions and kidney disease. The underlying enzyme deficiency was not identified until the late 1960s, leading to the development of enzyme replacement therapy in the early 2000s.",
