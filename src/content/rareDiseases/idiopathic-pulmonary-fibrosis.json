    "description": "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and ultimately fatal disease characterized by the scarring (fibrosis) of the lung tissue. The cause is unknown (idiopathic), and the scarring leads to shortness of breath, cough, and reduced oxygen levels in the blood. The disease primarily affects older adults and has a variable rate of progression.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your lungs are like a sponge, and in IPF, the sponge gets hard and stiff, making it difficult to breathe. Doctors don't know exactly why this happens, but there are medicines to help slow it down.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause, occurring primarily in older adults, limited to the lungs, and associated with the histopathologic and/or radiologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). The diagnosis requires exclusion of other known causes of interstitial lung disease. The clinical course is variable, but characterized by progressive dyspnea, cough, and eventual respiratory failure. High-resolution CT imaging and lung biopsy are crucial for diagnosis. Management focuses on antifibrotic medications (pirfenidone and nintedanib), supportive care, and lung transplantation in eligible candidates.",
    "historicalBackground": "IPF was first described in the mid-20th century, with increasing recognition and research into its pathogenesis and treatment options over the decades. The introduction of antifibrotic therapies in the 21st century marked a significant advancement in the management of the disease.",
