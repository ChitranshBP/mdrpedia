    "description": "Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita (AMC) describes a condition characterized by multiple joint contractures present at birth. It is not a specific diagnosis but rather a descriptive term encompassing a variety of underlying conditions that limit fetal movement in the womb. These contractures can affect any joint but commonly involve the hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, and feet. The severity and specific joints affected vary widely among individuals with AMC.",

    "clinicalSummary": "Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita (AMC) is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by congenital joint contractures affecting two or more body areas. The underlying etiology is diverse, encompassing genetic factors (mutations in genes involved in muscle development, neuronal function, or connective tissue synthesis), environmental factors (oligohydramnios, maternal illness), and neuromuscular disorders. Pathologically, AMC results from decreased or absent fetal movement during gestation, leading to abnormal joint and muscle development. Clinical presentation varies widely, ranging from mild contractures treatable with conservative measures to severe, debilitating deformities requiring extensive surgical intervention. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and genetic testing to identify the underlying cause. Management focuses on improving joint mobility, preventing further deformities, and maximizing functional independence through physical therapy, occupational therapy, serial casting, bracing, and surgical correction.",
    "historicalBackground": "Descriptions of congenital contractures date back to ancient times. However, the term 'Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita' was formally introduced in the medical literature in the 20th century to describe the constellation of findings associated with multiple congenital joint contractures.",
