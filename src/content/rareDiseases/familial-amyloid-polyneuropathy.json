    "description": "Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP) is a rare, progressive, and inherited disorder caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene. These mutations lead to the misfolding and aggregation of TTR protein, forming amyloid fibrils that deposit in various tissues and organs, primarily affecting the peripheral nerves, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. This deposition causes nerve damage, leading to sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body makes a protein that's supposed to help, but it gets folded wrong and clumps together. These clumps stick to your nerves and heart, causing them to not work properly. It's like having sticky stuff clogging up the wires and pipes in your body. Doctors can give you medicine to stop the protein from clumping or even replace the part of your body that's making the bad protein.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP), or hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv), is a systemic amyloidosis caused by mutations in the TTR gene. Mutant TTR protein misfolds and aggregates into amyloid fibrils, depositing in peripheral nerves, heart, kidneys, and other organs. Clinically, patients present with a length-dependent sensorimotor neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, bowel and bladder dysfunction), cardiomyopathy, and other organ involvement. Diagnosis involves clinical suspicion, genetic testing for TTR mutations, and tissue biopsy to confirm amyloid deposition. Treatment options include TTR stabilizers (tafamidis, diflunisal), RNA interference therapies (patisiran, vutrisiran), antisense oligonucleotides (inotersen), and liver transplantation (in select cases). Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to slow disease progression and improve patient outcomes.",
    "historicalBackground": "FAP was first described in Portugal in the 1950s by Dr. Corino de Andrade. Initially, liver transplantation was the only available treatment option. The discovery of TTR as the causative protein and subsequent development of TTR stabilizers and gene silencing therapies have revolutionized the treatment landscape.",
