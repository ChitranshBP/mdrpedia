    "description": "Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT) is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that primarily occurs in adolescents and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of small, round, blue cells surrounded by a desmoplastic stroma (dense fibrous tissue). DSRCT most commonly arises in the abdomen but can also occur in other locations such as the pelvis, chest, and extremities. The tumor is driven by a specific chromosomal translocation that results in the fusion of the EWSR1 gene and the WT1 gene.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine tiny bad cells growing in your tummy or other parts of your body. These cells are called Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor, or DSRCT. It's a rare type of cancer that's hard to treat, but doctors use surgery, medicine, and special rays to try and make you better.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT) is a rare and aggressive sarcoma characterized by distinctive histological features, including nests of small round cells surrounded by a prominent desmoplastic stroma. The tumor cells typically express markers such as WT1 (C-terminus), desmin, cytokeratins, and NSE. The pathognomonic feature is the presence of the EWSR1-WT1 fusion transcript, resulting from the t(11;22)(p13;q12) chromosomal translocation. Clinically, DSRCT presents with abdominal or pelvic masses, often with widespread peritoneal involvement. The disease course is typically aggressive, with a high propensity for local recurrence and distant metastasis. Treatment involves a multimodality approach, including aggressive surgical resection, multi-agent chemotherapy (e.g., P6 protocol), and radiation therapy. HIPEC may be considered in select cases. Despite aggressive therapy, the prognosis remains poor.",
    "historicalBackground": "DSRCT was first described as a distinct entity in 1989 by Gerald et al. The characteristic EWSR1-WT1 translocation was identified in the early 1990s, solidifying its classification as a unique sarcoma subtype.",
