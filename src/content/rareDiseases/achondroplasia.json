    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your bones didn't grow as long as they should. That's like achondroplasia! It makes people shorter, especially their arms and legs. They might also have a bigger head and need help with breathing sometimes.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Achondroplasia is a skeletal dysplasia caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene, leading to constitutive activation of the receptor and impaired endochondral ossification. Clinically, it presents with rhizomelic dwarfism, macrocephaly, frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia, and trident hands. Complications include spinal stenosis, foramen magnum compression, and respiratory issues. Diagnosis is based on clinical and radiographic findings, confirmed by genetic testing. Management involves addressing complications and may include surgical interventions and, more recently, targeted therapies like vosoritide.",
    "historicalBackground": "Achondroplasia has been recognized since ancient times, with depictions found in ancient Egyptian and Roman art. The genetic basis was elucidated in the 1990s with the discovery of mutations in the FGFR3 gene.",
