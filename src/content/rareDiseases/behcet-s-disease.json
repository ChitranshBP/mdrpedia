    "description": "Behcet's Disease is a rare, chronic, multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis (eye inflammation). It can also involve the skin, joints, blood vessels, nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract. The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to be an autoimmune condition triggered by genetic and environmental factors.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body is getting confused and attacking itself. Behcet's is like that, causing sores in your mouth and private areas, and sometimes problems with your eyes and joints. Doctors can give you medicine to calm your body down.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Behcet's Disease is a chronic, relapsing-remitting, multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by mucocutaneous lesions (oral and genital ulcers), uveitis, and potential involvement of other organ systems. The pathogenesis involves genetic predisposition (HLA-B51 association), immune dysregulation, and environmental triggers. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on the International Study Group criteria. Management focuses on symptom control and prevention of organ damage using corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies. Prognosis varies depending on the severity and extent of organ involvement.",
    "historicalBackground": "Behcet's Disease was first described by Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Behçet in 1937. He identified the triad of oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis as the key features of the disease.",
