    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your skin is like a wall made of bricks, and the glue holding them together isn't working right. Ichthyosis is when your skin gets super dry and flaky because it can't hold onto moisture properly, like those bricks falling apart. Lotions and special creams can help keep your skin healthy!",
    "clinicalSummary": "Ichthyosis encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by abnormal epidermal differentiation and desquamation, resulting in visible scaling. The underlying pathophysiology involves mutations in genes responsible for keratinocyte structure, lipid metabolism, and epidermal barrier function. Clinical presentation varies widely, ranging from mild xerosis to severe, disfiguring scaling. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, skin biopsy, and genetic testing to identify the specific subtype and guide management. Treatment focuses on symptomatic relief through emollients, keratolytics, and retinoids, with emerging therapies targeting specific genetic defects.",
    "historicalBackground": "Descriptions of ichthyosis date back to ancient times, with early medical texts recognizing the characteristic scaling and dryness of the skin. The genetic basis of ichthyosis began to be elucidated in the 20th century, with the identification of specific gene mutations associated with different subtypes. Advances in molecular genetics have led to improved diagnostic capabilities and the development of targeted therapies.",
