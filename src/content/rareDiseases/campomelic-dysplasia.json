It is often associated with respiratory distress and other life-threatening complications in infancy.",

    "eli5Summary": "Campomelic dysplasia is a rare condition where babies are born with bent bones, breathing problems, and sometimes, boys can look like girls. It's very serious, and many babies don't live long, but doctors try to help them breathe and fix their bones.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Campomelic dysplasia (CMD) is a severe skeletal dysplasia primarily caused by heterozygous mutations in the SOX9 gene, a crucial transcription factor involved in skeletal and gonadal development. The characteristic bowing of long bones, particularly the femurs and tibias, results from abnormal chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. The frequent occurrence of 46,XY sex reversal is due to SOX9's role in testis determination. Clinical management focuses on supportive care, especially respiratory support, and surgical interventions to address skeletal deformities and cleft palate. Prognosis remains guarded, with high infant mortality.",
    "historicalBackground": "Campomelic dysplasia was first described in the early 1970s. The identification of SOX9 as the causative gene in the 1990s significantly advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of this condition.",
