    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your skin is like a delicate sticker. For kids with Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), their skin is so fragile that even a little touch can cause it to tear and form blisters, like when you peel a sticker too hard. They need special care to protect their skin.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders characterized by blistering of the skin and mucous membranes following minor trauma. The underlying pathology involves mutations in genes encoding structural proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction, such as keratin, collagen, and laminin. These mutations disrupt the integrity of the skin, leading to separation and blister formation at different levels within the skin layers. Clinical manifestations vary widely depending on the specific EB subtype and the location of the genetic mutation. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, skin biopsy with immunofluorescence mapping and electron microscopy, and genetic testing to identify the causative mutation. Management focuses on supportive care, including meticulous wound care, pain management, nutritional support, and prevention of infections. Gene therapy and other novel therapeutic approaches are under investigation.",
    "historicalBackground": "The first clinical descriptions of Epidermolysis Bullosa date back to the late 19th century. Herlitz described the severe, lethal form of EB in 1935. The genetic basis of EB began to be elucidated in the late 20th century with the identification of mutations in genes encoding structural proteins of the skin.",
