    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body's soldiers (immune cells) have trouble making the right weapons to fight off bad germs. This makes you get sick more often, and your body might form lumps (granulomas) trying to contain the germs. Doctors can give you medicine to help prevent infections and sometimes even fix the problem with a special transplant.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by the inability of phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages) to produce superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to defects in the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex. This impaired oxidative burst compromises the cells' ability to kill catalase-positive bacteria and fungi, leading to recurrent and severe infections. The most common genetic defects involve mutations in the CYBB gene (X-linked CGD) or genes encoding other subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex (autosomal recessive forms). Clinical manifestations include pneumonia, abscesses, lymphadenitis, and granuloma formation in various organs. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by neutrophil function testing (DHR assay) and genetic analysis. Management involves prophylactic antibiotics and antifungals, interferon-gamma therapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for curative intent. Gene therapy is an emerging treatment option.",
    "historicalBackground": "CGD was first described in the 1950s as a fatal disease of childhood characterized by recurrent infections and granuloma formation. The underlying defect in neutrophil function was identified in the 1960s, and the genetic basis of the disease was elucidated in subsequent decades.",
