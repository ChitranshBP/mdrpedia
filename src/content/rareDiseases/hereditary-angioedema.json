    "description": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling (angioedema). The swelling most commonly affects the limbs, face, intestinal tract, and airway. HAE is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the C1 inhibitor protein, which is involved in regulating the complement system, a part of the immune system.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body has a security system that sometimes goes haywire and causes swelling. Hereditary Angioedema is like having a glitch in that security system, leading to sudden swelling attacks, especially in your face, tummy, or throat. Doctors can give you special medicine to fix the glitch and stop the swelling.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a genetic disorder resulting from a deficiency or dysfunction of C1 inhibitor (C1-INH), a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the complement, contact, and coagulation cascades. This deficiency leads to uncontrolled production of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator that increases vascular permeability, resulting in angioedema. HAE is characterized by recurrent, self-limiting episodes of non-pitting edema involving the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and upper airway. Diagnosis is based on measuring C4 and C1-INH levels and function. Acute attacks are treated with C1-INH concentrate, ecallantide, or icatibant. Prophylactic treatment includes C1-INH concentrate, lanadelumab, or attenuated androgens.",
    "historicalBackground": "Hereditary angioedema was first described by Quincke in 1888. In 1963, Donald and Rosen identified the deficiency of C1 inhibitor as the underlying cause. Subsequent research led to the development of effective treatments, significantly improving the prognosis for individuals with HAE.",
