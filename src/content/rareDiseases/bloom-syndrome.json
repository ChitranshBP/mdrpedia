    "description": "Bloom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by short stature, sun-sensitive skin rash (telangiectatic erythema) on the face, increased susceptibility to infections, and a significantly elevated risk of developing various cancers at a young age. It is caused by mutations in the BLM gene, which is responsible for DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability.",

    "eli5Summary": "Bloom syndrome is a rare problem where kids don't grow very tall, get a sunburn-like rash on their face easily, and have a higher chance of getting sick and getting cancer. It happens because their bodies have trouble fixing broken DNA.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Bloom syndrome (BS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the BLM gene, encoding a RecQ helicase involved in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. The hallmark features include proportionate short stature, facial telangiectatic erythema with sun sensitivity, immune deficiency, and a predisposition to a wide range of cancers, often at an early age. Chromosomal instability, manifested as increased sister chromatid exchange (SCE), is a key diagnostic feature. Management focuses on sun protection, infection control, cancer surveillance, and treatment of complications. The prognosis is guarded due to the high risk of malignancy.",
    "historicalBackground": "Bloom syndrome was first described in 1954 by Dr. David Bloom, a dermatologist, who observed a group of patients with characteristic facial telangiectasia and stunted growth.",
