    "description": "Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a failure of lymphocyte homeostasis, leading to chronic, non-malignant lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity, and an increased risk of lymphoma. The underlying defect involves impaired apoptosis (programmed cell death) of lymphocytes, resulting in their accumulation in lymphoid organs and subsequent autoimmune manifestations.",

    "eli5Summary": "Imagine your body's immune system has soldiers that don't know when to stop fighting. In ALPS, these soldiers (lymphocytes) don't die when they should, causing swelling in your body and attacking healthy cells. Doctors can use medicine to calm down these soldiers and help them behave.",
    "clinicalSummary": "Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) is a disorder of lymphocyte homeostasis characterized by defective apoptosis of lymphocytes, leading to lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity. Mutations in genes such as FAS, FASLG, and CASP10 disrupt the normal apoptotic pathway, resulting in the accumulation of autoreactive lymphocytes. Clinically, ALPS presents with chronic lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and autoimmune cytopenias. Elevated levels of double-negative T cells (DNTs) are a hallmark of the disease. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, immunophenotyping, apoptosis assays, and genetic testing. Treatment focuses on immunosuppression to control autoimmune manifestations and prevent complications such as lymphoma.",
    "historicalBackground": "ALPS was first described in the 1990s, with the genetic basis being elucidated in subsequent years. The discovery of mutations in FAS and other apoptosis-related genes provided critical insights into the pathogenesis of the disease.",
